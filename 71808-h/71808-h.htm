<p class="nind"><span class="sc">I have</span> tried to tell in
outline the story of the regulation of the Nile and some of its
consequences. A rash project, perhaps, for one who is not an
engineer; but, then, this book is not written for engineers, and
politics enter largely into it.</p>

<p>I have had some special opportunities of observation, and I have
many friends to thank for the help which they have given me. In
particular I am much indebted to the <em>Standard</em>, whose
special correspondent in Egypt and the Soudan I had the good
fortune to be during a part of 1902-1903.</p>

<p>Anyone who wishes to gain a real acquaintance with the
principles and details of Egyptian Irrigation should read the
monumental and interesting work by Sir W. Willcocks, K.C.M.G., on
that subject, to which my indebtedness is large.</p>

<p>The standard work on the Soudan is not yet written. There is but
one man who combines the necessary knowledge, experience, and
attainments to do it, and he, fortunately for the Soudan, is—and
will be for a long time to come—too fully occupied<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span> with his arduous and
multifarious duties. I mean, of course, the present
Governor-General, Sir Reginald Wingate. No official of the Soudan
Government, least of all he, has leisure to write a book; but I
sincerely hope that the materials for it are steadily
collecting.</p>

<span class="less">THE NILE</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Far</span> back in the world’s
history a fracture of the earth’s crust took place in the region
which is now Egypt, and the sea filled the valley as far as a point
not much north of Assouan. Into this fiord ran several rivers from
the high ground east and west, bearing down with them heaps of
detritus, and forming small deltas like the plain of Kom-Ombos. On
the sea-bottom were laid down deposits of sand and gravel, and then
the land began to rise. Meantime the volcanic movements of East
Central Africa had shaped the country into its present
configuration, and the rivers which drained from the great lakes
and swamps of the south, and those which flowed down from the high
plateau on the east, combining their waters somewhere about
Khartoum, pushed their marvellous course northwards, and began the
creation of the fertile soil of Egypt. From this time onwards the
climatic conditions must have continued very much what they are
to-day. Changes, of course, there have been in the level of the
land; but the sea-valley had become a river-valley, and year by
year the annual flood increased the cultivable soil, and refreshed
it with moisture, just as it would be<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_4">[4]</span> doing to-day if left untrammelled by the
devices of man.</p>

<p>Late in the history of the river-valley, but very early in the
history of humanity, this favoured strip of country became the home
of men, who doubtless cast their seed upon the slime left by the
retreating waters, and reaped their crops long before the dawn of
history. It is remarkable and characteristic of the conditions of
the country that tradition ascribes to the earliest King of Egypt,
Menes, the first King of the First Dynasty, the first attempts to
regulate the flow of the river—in other words, the first scheme of
irrigation proper.</p>

<p>If it were possible to divert the river from its course, and
effectually to bar its way before it reached the boundaries of
Egypt, what an appalling catastrophe would follow—no mere disaster,
but absolute annihilation! On the coast lands of the Mediterranean
a sparse population might still eke out a miserable existence by
storing the scanty rainfall, but nowhere else. The very oases of
the desert would be dried up, and in a short time the shifting
sands of the Sahara would have overlaid the deposits in the
river-valley, and buried out of sight even the ruins of the past.
The waters of the Nile are, and ever have been, the sole giver of
all life in Egypt.</p>

<p>Whoever finds himself in Cairo should lose no time in taking his
stand upon the bridge, and in reflecting upon the history of the
water that goes sliding and eddying beneath him, on the way to
perform its last duties among the cotton-fields of the delta. Some
of it has been travelling for three months from its sources beyond
the Victoria<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> Nyanza,
itself over 1,100 metres<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> above sea-level. From the
Victoria Nyanza it has passed down the Somerset Nile into the
Albert Nyanza, thence a five days’ journey to Lado, past Duffile
and the Fola Rapids. From Lado to Bor the fall is still rapid, but
henceforward as far as Khartoum, some 1,000 miles, the stream is on
a very feeble slope. Between Bor and the junction of the Ghazal
River on the left bank is the region of the sudd, floating masses
of compressed vegetation, which, if neglected entirely, block the
course of the river. Here, too, are the wide and desolate marshes,
inhabited by myriads of mosquitoes and that strange, melancholy
bird, the whale-headed stork (<i>Balæniceps rex</i>).</p>

<p>The Ghazal River contributes very little to the flow of the
Nile, owing to wide lagoons through which it passes, and which
cause great evaporation. The river then passes sharply to the
right, and sixty miles further on is joined by the Sobat from the
eastern hills, which in flood brings down a volume equal to that of
the Nile, but during summer contributes little or nothing. From the
white sediment brought down by the Sobat the White Nile derives its
name and colour. Hence it flows in a wide bed, a mile across on the
average, 540 miles to its junction with the Blue Nile at Khartoum.
Khartoum is still 1,800 miles from the sea, and 390 metres above
it. Two hundred miles north of Khartoum, near to Berber, the Atbara
River flows in, and hence the Nile pursues its solitary way through
the desert until, after a circuitous bend round Dongola, it bursts
through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> the rocky
defiles of Nubia, and emerges at Assouan into Egypt proper. Of the
distance between Khartoum and Assouan about 350 miles consist of
so-called cataracts, during which the total drop is 200 metres;
about 750 miles are ordinary channel, with a total drop of nearly
100 metres.</p>

<p>Of all the affluents of the Nile, the Blue Nile (assisted by its
tributaries, the Rahad and the Dinder) and the Atbara have been of
infinitely the greatest importance to Egypt in the past. Not only
do their waters contribute the largest proportion of the annual
flood, but also down them comes the rich volcanic detritus swept
from the Abyssinian hills by the heavy summer rains, which composes
the red-brown silt so dear to the Egyptian cultivator. To
understand the system of irrigation in Egypt it is necessary to
have a clear view of the amount of water derived from the different
sources at different times of the year.</p>

<p>The great lakes and swamps of Uganda, acting as reservoirs,
prevent any great differences in the discharge of water above Lado.
At that place the low Nile discharge is about 500 cubic
metres<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> per second; but, in spite of the Ghazal River
and the Sobat, so great is the loss by diffusion in the marshes and
by direct evaporation, that at Khartoum the discharge is no more
than 300 cubic metres per second. At this time the Blue Nile is
giving no more than 160 cubic metres per second at Khartoum, and
the Atbara is not running at all. The loss between Khartoum and
Assouan is about 50 cubic metres, and consequently the amount of
water passing Assouan in May in an ordinary year<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> is 410 cubic metres per second.
This is the summer supply of Egypt.</p>

<p>Meantime heavy rains have been falling about Lado and on the
Sobat. Towards April 15 the river begins to rise, the effect of
which is felt at Khartoum about May 20, and at Assouan about June
10. A most curious phenomenon accompanies this preliminary
increase—the appearance of the ‘green’ water. It used to be thought
that this ‘green’ water proceeded from the sudd region. During the
previous months the swamps in that country have been lying isolated
and stagnant under the burning tropical sun; their waters have
become polluted with decaying vegetable matter. When once more the
rising river overtops its banks, this fœtid water was supposed to
be swept out into the stream, and finally make its appearance in
Egypt. But a closer examination of the facts, which has only been
possible since the Soudan was re-opened, has caused this view to be
abandoned.</p>

<p>The ‘green water’ is caused by the presence of an innumerable
number of microscopic algæ, which give it a very offensive taste
and smell. So far as can be ascertained, their origin is in the
tributaries of the Sobat above Nasser. The rains in April carry
them out into the White Nile, and thence they pass down to Nubia
and Egypt. Under a hot sun and in clear water they increase with
amazing rapidity, and sometimes they form a column 250 to 500 miles
long. These weeds go on growing, drying, and decaying, until the
arrival of the turbid flood-water, which at once puts an end to the
whole process, as they cannot survive except in clear water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>Horrible as the
‘green’ water is, its appearance is hailed with delight by the
Egyptian, for he knows that it is the forerunner of the rushing
waters of the real flood-time, and the first sign of the coming
close of the water-famine. By September 1 the Nile at Lado has
reached its maximum of 1,600 cubic metres. In the valley of the
Sobat the rains last till November, with the result that by
September 15 or 20 the White Nile at Khartoum has attained its
maximum discharge of 4,500 cubic metres per second.</p>

<p>Meanwhile great things have been happening on the Blue Nile and
the Atbara. About July 5 the Blue Nile begins to rise, and the
flood comes down with considerable rapidity till it reaches its
maximum of 5,500 cubic metres per second on August 25. The famous
‘red’ water reaches Assouan on July 15, and is seen ten days later
at Cairo. The flood on the Atbara would begin at nearly the same
time as on the Blue Nile, but for the fact that it spends a month
in saturating its own dry bed and the adjoining country. Once it
begins, however, about July 5, it comes very rapidly, and about
August 20 reaches its maximum, which is usually some 3,400 cubic
metres per second, but occasionally amounts to as much as
4,900.</p>

<p>If these three contributors, the White Nile, the Blue Nile, and
the Atbara, all reached their maximum at the same time, the result
in an ordinary year would be a discharge at Assouan of some 13,000
to 14,000 cubic metres per second, and in occasional years a very
great deal more. But this is not the case. In an ordinary year the
Nile is at its lowest at Assouan at the end of May,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span> discharging no more than 410 cubic
metres per second. After the arrival of the ‘green’ water it rises
slowly till July 20. By that time the ‘red’ water is fairly on the
move, and the rise goes on with increased rapidity till the maximum
is reached, on September 5, of 10,000 cubic metres. But both date
and amount are liable to variation. If the White Nile flood is a
weak one, and the Atbara early, the maximum may be reached a day or
two earlier; but if the White Nile is very strong it will not be
attained until September 20. A late maximum, in other words, means
a good supply of water in the White Nile, and as the White Nile is
the principal source of supply after the flood is over, this fact
is of inestimable importance to Egypt. But occasionally, as in
1878, this is carried to excess. In that year the White Nile flood
was very late and very high. The maximum was not reached till
September 30, when 13,200 cubic metres per second were passing
Assouan, with very disastrous results in Egypt. All through the
following summer the supply was very good, and at its lowest, in
May, was more than three times as great as the average.<a id=
"FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>Curiously enough,
the preceding year offered a startling contrast. It was the lowest
Nile on record. The maximum was reached on August 20, and was some
3,500 cubic metres below the average, and in the following May the
discharge at Assouan fell to 230 cubic metres per second, as
against the average 410.</p>

<p>By the end of October the Atbara has usually disappeared
altogether, and the Blue Nile falls very quickly after the middle
of September. The White Nile, however, owing to the regulating
effect of its natural reservoirs and the slackness of its current,
is very much more deliberate in its fall, and the results at
Assouan are as follows in a normal year: By the end of September
the discharge has fallen to 8,000 cubic metres per second; end of
October to 5,000; end of November to 3,000; end of December to
2,000; end of January to 1,500; end of March to 650; and end of May
to 410.</p>

<p>In other countries the year is divided into seasons, reckoned
according to the position of the sun and the temperature, or
according to the rainfall. In Egypt the state of the all-important
river is the principal factor in determining the seasons. These
are, first, the months of the inundation, or Nili, August to
November; second,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span> the
winter, or Shitwi, December to March; and, third, the summer, or
Sefi, April to July, when the river is at its lowest. Nowhere else
do the actual seasons correspond with the nominal in a manner so
regular and unfailing. But, of course, within these limits there is
a great variation in the amounts of both the maximum and the
minimum of the volume of the Nile, and the dates at which they
occur from year to year. During the twenty-six years 1873-1898 the
maximum flood at Assouan varied from the exceptional height of 9·15
metres above zero on the gauge to the equally exceptional 6·40
metres. And the dates on which these maxima were attained varied
from October 1 in the first case to August 20 in the other. The
dates on which the volume of water passing through reached its
minimum varied from May 8 to June 24; while the worst lowest on
record was ·71 metre below zero, and the best was 1·88 metres above
it. (Zero, it should be explained, is the lowest level which the
river would touch in an average year.)</p>

<p>These figures are the result of the free and unimpeded flow of
the Nile. To us, with our wider field of observation, with our
knowledge of the sources of the Nile, and preciser information as
to the conditions prevailing in those distant countries, the
behaviour of the river seems, after all, but the resultant of many
natural causes, and capable of prediction, and even regulation. But
to those who, living in a country where rain was practically
unknown, knew nothing of the tropical lakes or the rain-shrouded
hills of Abyssinia, and who merely saw the great river issuing from
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span> burning deserts
of the south in flood at the very time when other rivers were
parched and dried, how marvellous it must have seemed, and how
inexplicable must have appeared those occasional variations,
threatening destruction, on the one hand by excessive inundation,
and on the other by famine and drought! Few floods in the history
of Egypt can have been higher than that of 1878, and few lower than
that of 1877, when 1,000,000 acres were left without water. But
several great famines have been recorded in the past. Perhaps the
worst of these began in <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1064. A
succession of low Niles took place, lasting for seven years, like
the seven lean kine of Pharaoh’s dream. Terrible results followed.
Even human flesh was eaten, and the Caliph’s family had to flee to
Syria. Similar disasters occurred in <span class="sc2">A.D.</span>
1199.</p>

<p>Such extraordinary catastrophes are rare, but their possibility
is always present to the minds of those responsible for the
government and welfare of Egypt. We shall see what steps have been
taken to guard against them, and first we shall examine the
different systems of irrigation which have prevailed, and the
nature of the services which the water, whose variations we have
described, is made to perform before it finally reaches the
sea.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span><a id=
"c02"></a>CHAPTER II<br>
<span class="less">BASIN IRRIGATION</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">There</span> are two kinds of
irrigation in Egypt—basin and perennial irrigation. Basin
irrigation is the ancient and historical method of the country.
Tradition ascribes its invention to the first King of Egypt, and it
is obviously designed to take full advantage of the annual flood.
Practically the same as it was 7,000 years ago, it may be seen in
Upper Egypt to-day.</p>

<p>The cultivable land from Assouan to the Delta is, with the
exception of the Fayoum, that altogether remarkable province, a
narrow strip of country, varying in breadth from a few miles to
nothing at all, sometimes on both sides of the river, sometimes
only on one. Being of deltaic formation, the land is highest near
the river, and slopes away towards the desert. As the river flows
from south to north, there is, of course, also a general slope of
the country in the same direction. Earthen dykes are run at right
angles to the river as far as the desert, a dyke parallel to the
river and close to its bank connects them, and so a basin is
formed, enclosed on the fourth side by the desert. Thus the land is
arranged in a series of terraces. Usually these basins are arranged
in a series, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
basin draining into its neighbour, the last of the series
discharging back again into the Nile. Sometimes a second dyke,
parallel to the river, divides the lower land near the desert from
the higher; sometimes the arrangement is still further complicated
by other dykes, making enclosures within the area of the original
basin.</p>

<p>The object of the basins is to regulate the supply of the
flood-water. Each series of basins has special feeder canals to
lead into them. These are shallow, and have their bed about halfway
between the high and low level of the Nile. They are therefore dry
in the winter and summer, and only run during the flood. The heads
of these canals, where they take off from the Nile, remain closed
by dams or by masonry regulators till the silt-bearing flood is
coming down in sufficient strength. Then about August 10 or 12 the
canals are opened and the basins filled. The lowest basins in each
series are filled first, then the next lowest, and so on. In a low
flood, as in 1877, there is not enough muddy water to go round, and
the upper basins get no water at all; such lands are called
‘sharaki,’ and are exempt from taxation. For forty days the
flood-water stands on the land, thoroughly soaking it and washing
it, and at the same time depositing its fertilizing silt. At the
end of that time, through the escape at the lower end of the
series, the water is discharged back again into the Nile. But if
the flood is a very high one or very slow in abating, the date at
which the water can be discharged and the basins dried has to be
postponed. Fortunately, this seldom happens; but when it does it
has a doubly bad effect. The<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_15">[15]</span> oversoaking is said to engender worms, and
also the ripening of the crops is postponed to an unfavourable
season of the year.</p>

<p>Against this particular evil there is no remedy, but since the
British occupation a great deal has been done to improve the system
of basin irrigation, and prevent a large amount of sharaki even in
years of low Nile. These measures consist in arrangements for
distributing the ‘red’ water more evenly over the whole system, and
not allowing the lower basins only to receive the full benefit,
while the higher merely receive ‘white’ water—<i>i.e.</i>, water
which has already deposited its silt. Further, since any water is
better than none, the systems of basins have been so managed, where
possible, that the water from an upper system can be drained into a
lower one, and thus make up deficiencies, though with water of an
inferior quality. More attention has also been paid to the angle at
which the feeder canals take off from the Nile, and the slope on
which they are laid, so as to provide as much ‘red’ water as
possible, while diminishing the amount of silting up. The result of
this work is seen in the diminution of the sharaki lands year by
year. In 1877 these amounted to nearly 1,000,000 acres, a loss of
£1,000,000 in land-tax. During the next ten years the average was
45,000 acres, an annual loss of some £40,000. In 1888 the loss was
£300,000, and the Egyptian Government expended £800,000 in remedial
works, which have had an extraordinary effect. In 1899, when the
Nile was exceptionally low, the sharaki lands amounted to 264,000
acres only, as against nearly 1,000,000 in 1877.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>As for the high
lands lying immediately between the river and the basin dyke, only
eight or nine times in a century does the Nile rise high enough to
flood them. They are called ‘berms,’ and are ingeniously irrigated
by means of special high-level canals, which, starting from a point
above the head of the basin system, or perhaps leading down from an
upper system, pass by means of a siphon under the feeder canal. The
berms are, of course, also irrigated by lifting water directly from
the Nile itself.</p>

<p>There are forty-five systems of basins in Upper Egypt, most of
which, and those the largest, are on the left bank. Some of the
feeder canals are insignificant, and feed only two or three basins.
Others, like the Sohagia Canal, south of Assiout, feed an extensive
system, and are real rivers when full. The basins themselves are
5,000 to 15,000 acres in extent, and it can easily be understood
that when they are taking in they have an enormous effect in
diminishing the pressure of the flood, and, on the other hand,
their discharge lengthens it out in the lower reaches of the river,
when the level has already fallen very much at Assouan. While the
basins are filling in August and September, they absorb about 2,000
cubic metres per second. Besides this, a considerable amount is
employed in filling the channel of the Nile itself and its
branches. Evaporation, absorption, and direct irrigation, also play
their part, and the result is that the discharge of the Nile at
Cairo is some 2,500 cubic metres less than it is at Assouan. But
during October and November the basins are discharging. The
southernmost ones are empty<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_17">[17]</span> by October 15, those in the neighbourhood of
Cairo not till about November 30, or even later. The consequence is
that the Nile at Cairo in October is discharging 900 cubic metres
per second more than at Assouan, and in November 500 more.</p>

<p>In November, therefore, the visitor to Cairo can still get some
idea of what Upper Egypt is like in flood-time. From desert to
desert it stretches, one vast lake, divided by a network of dykes,
and studded here and there with villages raised on artificial
mounds, which year by year rise higher on their own ruins. A
greater flood than usual makes terrible havoc in these villages;
for the rising water soon crumbles their mud walls, and the whole
collapses like a pack of cards. Every mortal thing is living on the
dykes, which play the part of roads; only the water-fowl, emerging
in thousands from their secluded marshes, spread themselves in
security over the wide waters, and here and there an isolated
villager may be seen in an ancient palm-wood tub, paddling and
baling by turns. The dykes run on the same lines as they have run
for centuries, and on them the traveller, on his way to visit the
Pyramids of Gizeh or the Tombs of the Kings at Sakkarah, the
burial-ground of ancient Memphis, may watch the whole life of Egypt
pass and repass in long procession, set as in a frieze. Work in the
fields, of course, is at a standstill, but the villages are humming
with preparation for the sowing, and alive with flocks of goats and
sheep, camels, buffaloes, and asses; even the rats have been forced
to the same refuge, and may be seen popping in and out among
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span> roots of the
palm-trees.<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> Where one basin drains into another the
fisherman spreads his net, and reaps a rich harvest in the rush of
the current. At intervals are stationed pickets of grave watchers,
squatting patiently alongside large bundles of millet or maize
stalks. This is all that remains of the corvée service, and gladly
is it borne.</p>

<p>For every villager is interested in the preservation of the
dykes, and apart from ordinary accidents this great lake, owing to
the swift changes of temperature in the neighbouring desert, is
liable to violent storms, which drive great waves against the
crumbling dykes, and would soon break them if left alone. The
millet stalks are put down to break the force of the waves. Each
village omdeh, or headman, is responsible for these arrangements,
and he, too, may be met upon the dykes, a picturesque figure in
flowing black and white, mounted on an ambling Arab pony, going
round to see that all his sentinels are on duty. How near the past
is brought, when you enter the tombs and find painted on the walls,
or figured out in stone, the same people engaged in the same
pursuits, as though Egypt had not been since then for thousands of
centuries coveted and seized in turn by so many invading nations!
The cultivator of the soil, moulded by the unchanging and imperious
demands of the great river, to which he owes his whole subsistence,
has retained the customs, and even the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_19">[19]</span> features, of those remote forerunners, who
are his ancestors in everything, except, perhaps, by descent of
blood.</p>

<p>Under the Pharaohs and under the Romans the whole of Lower as
well as Upper Egypt was under basin irrigation, and the whole
country was cultivated. In those days Egypt was the granary of the
Mediterranean, and at the time of the Arab conquest, <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span> 700, her population was estimated to number
12,000,000. Under Arab rule began that period of deterioration
which lasted for 1,100 years, and which, had the system of
irrigation been less natural to the physical conditions of the
country and less simple, would have resulted in an absolute
abandonment of cultivation, and reduced Egypt to the state in which
Mesopotamia, once the garden of the world, finds itself to-day.
Even as it was, by <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1800 the
population was brought down to about 2,000,000, and all the
northernmost and greater half of the Delta had become a neglected
and uncultivated swamp. War, famine, and pestilence, in turn, had
played their part; but the fundamental cause of all was the
misgovernment, which had neglected the irrigation. For in basin
irrigation, as, indeed, with all irrigation, two things are of the
utmost importance: the first, to get the water on to the land; and
the second, to drain it off again. Salt is the great enemy to be
fought. Not only do the Nile waters contain a large quantity of
salts, in solution, but the strata underlying the alluvial
deposits, being of marine origin, are also rich in salts. If the
water is allowed to stand on the land, evaporation takes place,
until nothing but a salt efflorescence is left.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> While if the land be so
water-logged that the level at which water can be obtained by
digging is brought near to the surface, the water containing salts
from below is drawn upwards by means of capillary attraction, and
once more evaporation takes place, leaving the salts in the soil.
It is clear that as the natural level of the land approaches
sea-level it becomes more and more troublesome to provide proper
means of carrying off the water. Accordingly, the northernmost
parts of the Delta were the first to suffer, and gradually the line
of cultivation receded.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. No one looking at a map of the Delta can fail
to have been struck by that extraordinary feature of the northern
coast-line, the great lakes. At the present time there are in the
Delta about 3,430,000 acres of land cultivated or under
reclamation, and another 500,000 acres of waste land. North of
these lie 1,180,000 acres, either permanently covered by the lakes
or else flooded by them from September to December. Between the
lakes and the sea is a belt of sand-dunes or sandy plains, pierced
occasionally by openings. The sand-dunes are constantly being
augmented by the prevailing north-west winds. These lakes or
lagoons are for the most part extremely salt, and are distributed
as follows, beginning from the west: Lake Mareotis, 70,000 acres;
Edku, 60,000 acres; Borillos, 180,000 acres, and as much more
during flood and early winter; and Lake Menzalah on the east,
largest of all, 490,000 acres, and flooding 200,000 acres more at
the same time of year. All these waste lands, now known as the
Berea, were cultivated<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_21">[21]</span> in Roman times, some being occupied by
vineyards, others by wheat, and it would seem that the lakes were
kept from extending landwards by dykes. But when the land was
allowed to go out of cultivation no one had any interest in looking
after the regulation of the lakes. First, the passage through the
sand-dunes became silted up, because, as the basins decreased in
number, less water was drained from them into the lakes at the time
of the inundation. Then, after the closing of the openings, the
water gradually rose, breached the neglected dykes, and completed
the ruin of the land. Once the openings in the dunes are closed,
the lake has to rise to a considerable height before it can force
its way through again, owing to the continuous action of the sand
driven by the wind. In this way it came to pass that neither of the
lakes had more than one opening into the sea, and consequently,
rising in flood-time above sea-level, invaded the lands to the
south.</p>

<p>Another cause may have possibly contributed to the same
effect—namely, a sinking of the coast lands. Nowhere is this a more
probable explanation of the facts than in the neighbourhood of Lake
Manzalah. Before the Arab conquest much of what is now a shallow
lake was famous for its gardens, palm-groves, vineyards, and
wheat-fields; besides its agricultural villages, it contained towns
famous for their cloth and cutlery manufactures, like Tunah,
Damirah, Dabik, and, above all, Tinnis. But at the time of the
conquest these towns were already islands in the lake, a position
which enabled them to be the last stronghold of Coptic resistance
to the Moslems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>Whatever the cause
or the combination of causes—and the history of these tracts
remains very obscure—the results were the retreat southwards of the
cultivated area, with the consequence that, after over 1,000 years
of Mohammedan rule, Egypt found herself in the weakened and
impoverished condition already described; saved only from
annihilation by the system of basin irrigation, of which the
traditions survived, though in a diminished area, stubbornly
preserved from age to age by her industrious and conservative
peasantry.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span><a id=
"c03"></a>CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="less">PERENNIAL IRRIGATION</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">It</span> was the Viceroy Mehemet
Ali who revolutionized the methods of Egyptian agriculture, and
introduced what is known as perennial irrigation—that is to say,
irrigation all the year round, as opposed to irrigation during the
flood only. In all the annals of the East there are few more
striking figures and few histories more exciting than that of the
Albanian tobacco-seller, who, rising high in the favour of Sultan
Mahmoud, was sent to Egypt as Viceroy in 1810. Adopting a method
well known in Cairo, and well calculated to secure the respect, and
even the affection, of Orientals, he consolidated his power by the
treacherous murder of the Mamelukes, and thoroughly organized the
military resources of his province. Summoned to the aid of the
Sultan, his armies bloodily stamped out the successful rising of
the Greeks in the Peloponnese, and left to himself he would have
settled the question of Greek independence once for all. But his
summary proposal to transport the whole Christian population, and
repeople the Morea with Mohammedan plantations, provoked the
intervention of the Powers, and at Navarino he suffered the
complete loss of his fleet. Undismayed, he conceived
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span> idea of making
himself master of the Turkish Empire. His armies overran Syria, and
easily overcoming the Turkish opposition, he threatened
Constantinople itself. Once more, if left to himself, he would have
succeeded in his object, but once more the slow processes of
European diplomacy at last resulted in action. British guns gave
the death-blow to his hopes at Acre, and Turkey was saved from her
ambitious vassal, though Egypt remained a practically independent
State, and her sovereignty became the hereditary appanage of the
house of Mehemet.</p>

<p>In the region of domestic policy this strange combination of
barbarism and genius proved that he retained the commercial
instincts of the tobacco-seller as well as the far-reaching ideas
and the drastic methods of the despot. He perceived the advantages
which would accrue from the cultivation of cotton and the
sugar-cane, hitherto unknown in Egypt. These crops are impossible
under a system of basin irrigation; for though they require to be
watered all through the summer, they would be ruined by complete
inundation, and the shallow flood canals are well above the summer
level of the river. But difficulties were nothing to Mehemet Ali.
The corvée was called out, and the unfortunate fellaheen were set
to work to dig new canals and reconstruct the existing water-ways
in the Delta, so as to render them capable of conveying water
during the period of low Nile. At the same time the dykes along the
banks of the Nile and the canals were very much strengthened, so as
to keep out the flood; the old basin dykes were obliterated, and
arrangements made for irrigating the land from the new canals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>Of course,
perennial irrigation in itself had always existed in Egypt. It
would have been indeed strange if the principle applied by anybody
who daily waters a window-box had not occurred to the Egyptians.
The Nile berms were often enclosed to protect them from inundation,
and watered directly from the river all the year round, while
within the basins themselves considerable tracts were irrigated
from wells. But never before had special canals been provided by
Government for perennial irrigation. The advantages of perennial
irrigation are that crops like cotton and sugar can be grown, which
would otherwise be impossible, and that two, or even three crops,
can be produced in a year, instead of only one. The land is
therefore increased in value, but, on the other hand, there are
serious objections. First of all, the land is deprived of the full
benefit derived from the annual renewal of the soil by the silt
deposit. Agriculture becomes a much more intricate and difficult
process; the exhausted soil has to be constantly refreshed and
stimulated by dressings and manures. The basin irrigator makes less
profits, but he has less risk and less anxiety; he can only ride a
donkey, while the perennial irrigator can ride a horse. But behind
the horseman sits black Care. A low summer supply means to him the
waste of many weeks’ labour and much expenditure in preparing and
sowing his fields; the basin irrigator does nothing till the flood
is over, and should the inundation not cover a part of his land, it
merely means that that part lies fallow for another year, and
suffers no deterioration. A breach in the dykes during the flood is
inconvenient to the one,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_26">[26]</span> no doubt, but fatal to the other, for it
means the ruin of his growing cotton or sugar. And under perennial
irrigation it is much more likely to occur, for the basins act as a
safety-valve in the inundation, and, while they lengthen out the
period of the flood in Lower Egypt, enormously decrease its volume
at any given time; but when the same lands are receiving only an
occasional watering, the volume that rushes to the sea is by so
much the greater, and the pressure on the dykes is heavily
increased.</p>

<p>If Mehemet Ali had been content to preserve the old basin dykes,
the vivifying effects of the flood-water might have been
occasionally applied, and some of these dangers averted. But, as we
have seen, everything had to give way to the immediate cultivation
of cotton, and the dykes were levelled. Nor was this the only error
committed. The new canals were faulty in slope and alignment. Too
often their subsidiaries were constructed merely with the object of
carrying water to the lands of powerful and favoured individuals,
without regard to the general interest. It was found in consequence
that an enormous silting up of the canals took place every year.
But the Viceroy, with all the forced labour of Egypt at his free
disposal, took little heed of this, and vast numbers of men were
dragged from their homes every year to redig the canals. Even so it
was impossible for the task to be completed before the next flood
came round. The lower reaches of the canals remained choked with
mud and weeds, and, worst of all, proper drainage was
neglected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>When Napoleon was
in Egypt in 1798, his master mind, accustomed to go to the root of
many matters in spite of all the alarms and distractions of war,
perceived how much might be done by a regulation of the water at
the point of the Delta. His idea was to close each branch of the
river alternately during the flood, and so double its effect.
Mehemet Ali proposed to apply the same principle to low-water, and
began to close the head of the Rosetta or left-hand branch of the
Nile with an enormous stone dam, so as to divert the whole supply
into the Damietta branch. Linant Pasha, then chief of the French
engineers, who had been brought over to advise upon the new works,
persuaded him to abandon this design, and proposed instead to build
a barrage upon each branch, constructing them in the dry, and then
diverting the Nile into its new course by means of earthen dams.
The Viceroy approved, and at once proposed, with characteristic
energy, to dismantle the Pyramids and make use of their material,
just as Sultan Hasan had once stripped the marble casing from the
Great Pyramid to construct his famous mosque. Fortunately, the
prosaic question of transport arrested this design, and new
limestone quarries were opened near Cairo instead. But although
workshops were built, material collected, and foundations dug,
Mehemet seems to have lost all interest in the work, and in 1835 he
abandoned it altogether, and for seven years nothing more was heard
of it.</p>

<p>Two things appear to have operated in his mind. It seemed
simpler to keep on digging out the main canals by the help of the
corvée, and cheaper, too,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_28">[28]</span> because nothing was wanted but the unpaid
labour, though it was false economy. And, secondly, his
ill-regulated but far-reaching imagination was already busy upon a
new idea, nothing less than the construction of a great reservoir,
which should store up the surplus water of the winter and let it
out again in the summer, thereby, as he supposed, rendering
unnecessary the construction of any minor work like a barrage.</p>

<p>Surely there can be no more curious instance of the irony of
fate than the history of these two great ideas—the Barrage and the
Reservoir. Both in turn have been carried into successful execution
by engineers and statesmen belonging to the very nation which
shattered the ambitions of their first authors. Against the
crumbling walls of Acre, held so stoutly for weeks by the English
sea-captain, when even the notion of a day’s defence seemed a
madness, Napoleon’s dreams of Eastern empire dashed themselves
vainly to pieces. Forty years later the same walls could not
withstand for half a day the guns of their former defenders, and
Mehemet Ali in turn saw his own imperial dreams finally dissolve.
Mehemet neglected the Barrage, because he thought the Reservoir
would make it unnecessary; and yet in the end it was only the
successful working of the Barrage which gave new life to the
project of the Reservoir, and made its completion an absolute
necessity.</p>

<p>The Viceroy, perhaps, deserves little credit for his idea. In
matters of irrigation it is often much easier to see what to do
than how to do it; like other great men, he imagined better than he
knew. Undoubtedly he was fascinated by the fame of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> King Amenemhat of the Twelfth
Dynasty, and his construction of Lake Mœris in the Fayoum. He
constructed a new regulator at the spot where the Bahr Yusuf enters
that extraordinary province, and even built himself a house there.
But whether because of the inherent difficulties of the subject, or
because of foreign complications, nothing was done until in 1842
his mind reverted to the idea of the Barrage at the point of the
Delta. The Frenchman Mougel had the address to couple his design
with a scheme of military fortifications, and, attracted by this
double advantage, Mehemet at once ordered the works to be begun,
though, unfortunately, his energy was more devoted to making the
point of the Delta the military capital of Egypt than towards the
regulation of the water. By this time, however, Mehemet Ali’s
career was drawing to a close, and in 1848 he died, leaving the
work in which he never more than half believed still
unfinished.</p>

<p>It is difficult to conceive anything more humiliating and
exasperating than the position of the French engineers who acted as
advisers to the Egyptian Government. Time has vindicated their
reputation, and proved the excellence of their designs and the
soundness of their work; but in their own day they had to suffer
disappointment, and even disgrace, and to bear the brunt of
failure, due not to themselves, but to the conditions under which
they lived. With no authority to enforce the execution of their
plans, hampered at every turn, sometimes by the incompetence, and
always by the unwillingness, of the Arab engineers through whom
they had to work, supported only occasionally<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_30">[30]</span> by the uncertain breeze of viceregal
caprice, they struggled bravely on, and deserve the greatest credit
for what they did manage to accomplish. In 1853 Abbas Pasha, the
then Viceroy, dismissed Mougel from his service, to mark his
displeasure at the slowness of the building, and appointed a new
man. Little was gained by the change. The Barrages were nominally
finished in 1863, and an attempt was made to close the gates on the
Rosetta branch. But a settlement took place, and they had to be
immediately reopened. Not till 1872 was the Barrage really used,
and then only partially on the Rosetta branch, and not at all on
the Damietta. Still, whereas before 1872 only 250,000 acres of
summer crops had been matured in the Delta, and that at the cost of
enormous labour in clearing the canals, afterwards the total was
600,000 acres, and the cost of maintenance was very much less. The
ordinary summer supply available for the Delta canals was increased
from 64 cubic metres per second to 150.</p>

<p>This success brought home to the mind of the then reigning
Khedive, Ismail, the advantages of perennial irrigation and the
cultivation of cotton, and he determined to extend the system to
Upper Egypt and the Fayoum, where he possessed huge estates,
amassed by fair means and foul through the agency of the notorious
Mufettish, Said. Accordingly, in 1873 the great Ibrahimiyah Canal
was dug. Starting from near Assiout, it runs for 268 kilometres
nearly parallel to the Nile on its left bank, and supplies
perennial irrigation to 252,000 acres in the provinces of Assiout,
Minia, and Beni-Suêf.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
It also carries flood-water to a series of basins lying to the west
of it, nearer the desert. Before 1873 the Bahr Yusuf, which feeds
the Fayoum, took its water direct from the Nile, but its head was
now transferred to the left bank of the Ibrahimiyah Canal at Dêrut,
and 327,000 acres in the Fayoum came nominally under perennial
irrigation.</p>

<p>It would perhaps have been more reasonable to perfect the
irrigation system of Lower Egypt, and to complete the Barrages
entirely, before embarking on new projects in Upper Egypt. But the
temptation to improve his own lands by simply calling out the
corvée to dig canals was too strong for Ismail; and, indeed, he was
not the man to devote himself to the carrying out of old projects
to the exclusion of new ones. In him the vigorous and practical
originality of his grandfather Mehemet appeared in the form of a
fantastic imagination running riot in all directions, unrestrained
by the prosaic considerations of time and means. Yet with able
Ministers he might have been one of the greatest of rulers. In
spite of all the degradation which his reckless extravagance
brought on Egypt, the country owes him something; for there was
generally something great in his ideas, and time is carrying many
of them into effect. It is impossible not to feel some admiration
for the man who, when asked what gauge the Soudan railway should
be, replied, ‘Make it the same as that of the railways in South
Africa. It will save trouble in the end.’</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span><a id=
"c04"></a>CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="less">THE CULTURE OF THE FIELDS</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">It</span> has already been
explained that on the Nile berms or high banks, which are covered
by the flood only once in six or seven years, on islands in the
river, and on selected tracts within the basins in the
neighbourhood of wells, it has been the immemorial custom to lift
water on to the fields. Everywhere the two primitive instruments of
ancient Egypt are in common use to-day—the shadoof and the sakieh.
The shadoof is a long pole balanced on a support. From one end of
it is suspended a bucket, and from the other a heavy counterpoise,
equal in weight to the bucket when full of water. The bucket is
made of various materials, very often leather, though the ordinary
kerosene-oil tin of commerce is making its presence felt here as
elsewhere. The shadoof is worked by hand. The bucket is pulled down
into the water, then lifted up by the help of the counterpoise, and
its contents are tipped over into the channel leading to the
cultivated land, where the water is steered by means of miniature
canals and dams into the required direction. I suppose there could
not be a simpler form of unskilled labour than working the shadoof.
Whenever I think of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_33">[33]</span> fellah of Upper Egypt, I think of the
shadoof. Up and down, creak and splash, hour after hour, day after
day, he goes on lifting and tilting, with an amazing and monotonous
regularity. Nothing disturbs him—not even a steamer grounded on a
sand-bank twenty yards in front of him. As he stands, naked except
for a loin-cloth of blue cotton, with his absolutely dull,
impassive features, his magnificent chest and arms but weak legs,
you cannot help wondering which came first, the shadoof or the
shadoof-man, so perfectly are they adapted to each other. Two
piastres are the humble guerdon of the long day’s labour. You can
calculate upon the fellah as you could on a machine. But, in spite
of it all, deep down in his soul lies the sentiment which redeems
him and distinguishes him from a mere machine—his absorbing love
for the soil. Take him away, set him to other tasks—to serve, for
instance, in the army—he will perform his duties with the same
unfaltering regularity and docility; but all the time he is
thinking in his heart of the black soil and the water of Egypt. In
Omdurman I asked a more than usually intelligent Egyptian soldier,
who had been told off to perform some small services for me, ‘Do
you like being in the army?’ Without hesitation came the answer,
‘No.’ ‘What do you want to do?’ ‘I wish to be at home,’ he said,
‘and cultivate the ground.’</p>

<p>With a single shadoof water can be lifted 2½ metres; but when
the bank is high a second or third tier of shadoofs is employed,
and in some places as many as five shadoofs may be seen lifting the
water from one level to another, till it reaches<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> the fields. One man working
twelve hours a day can lift enough water to irrigate an acre of
cotton or corn in ten days.</p>

<p>The sakieh, or Persian water-wheel, consists of a vertical wheel
with a string of buckets attached to it, which, as the wheel turns
round, are let down into the water, come up full, and discharge
their contents into a channel as they come to the top. The wheel is
turned by means of spokes, which catch in a horizontal wheel worked
by oxen, buffaloes, or some other beast of burden. If the lift is
high, the string of buckets may be very long; but if the wheel
itself dips into the water, there may be no string at all, and it
is then called a taboot. The buckets are often earthenware
pitchers, and the wheels themselves are generally of the rudest
construction, and made of palm wood; but new and improved iron
water-wheels are coming into use. Still, whether of iron or of
wood, they all seem to make the same peculiar sing-song whine.
There is no sound more characteristic of Egypt. It has a peculiar
penetration. Night and day it continues. I believe Egyptian music
is founded upon it. The fellaheen say the cattle will not work
unless they hear it. Certainly when one stops, the other stops
also.</p>

<p>In the Fayoum, where, owing to the difference in the levels, the
canals have often a very high velocity, there are very ingenious
water-wheels or turbines, which play the part of sakiehs, but are
turned by the force of the current; the water thus lifts itself
continuously.</p>

<p>Where the lift is very little, shadoofs and sakiehs are replaced
by instruments called Natalis<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_35">[35]</span> and Archimedean screws; but, naturally, since
the introduction of perennial irrigation has so increased the area
to be watered by lift, machinery has had to be called in, and most
of the work is done by pumps worked by steam. Each large land-owner
has his own pump and engine, which can be moved from place to
place, and are also hired out to the smaller men. On very large
estates stationary engines have been erected, which, of course, are
able to raise a much larger amount of water; but as a rule the
machinery employed is a portable eight-horse-power engine and an
eight-inch centrifugal pump.</p>

<p>How different is all this from the lot of the agriculturist in
other lands! For him there is no digging or maintenance of canals;
no apparatus of regulators, dams, sluice-gates, siphons, and
drains; no painful lifting of the water by pumps and engines,
shadoofs, and sakiehs. The rain falls upon his fields from heaven
without any effort of his. He looks to Providence to regulate his
supply; the Egyptian looks to a Government department. But the
Egyptian, as a compensation for his extra labour, has the advantage
of greater certainty. He knows the sun will shine. The rise and
fall of the Nile, variable as it is, can be foretold with greater
exactness than that of any other river—with far greater exactness
than the duration of the rainy season in any country in the world.
Nature indeed made his task simple in the extreme, if he had been
content with one crop a year. Every year the flood thoroughly
washed the land, and kept it free from injurious salts; it also
covered them with a deposit of mud, which<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_36">[36]</span> relieved him from the necessity of dressing
and manuring the exhausted soil. The Nile silt, though singularly
rich in potash, the principal food of leguminous plants, like peas,
beans, and clover, is, however, very poor in the nitrates on which
cereals depend. But the Egyptian clover, called bersine, has the
property of secreting nitrates from the air, and depositing them in
the soil to an extraordinary extent, so that the land was able to
bear crops of clover and cereals in rotation to an unlimited extent
without any manuring. The desire to grow rich by crops like cotton
and sugar, and by forcing the land to double its output, has
changed all this. Not only has the summer supply of water become of
the utmost importance, but the soil has to be constantly refreshed
with manures. The question of manures is, indeed, only second,
under perennial irrigation, to the question of water.</p>

<p>Wherever cattle and stock are numerous, farmyard manure is used,
as well as the guano from the immense colonies of pigeons, kept for
the purpose in specially built pigeon-lofts throughout Egypt.
Between Halfa and Kena there are inexhaustive supplies of nitrates
in the desert, and north of Kena the mounds which mark the sites of
ancient cities, like Abydos, Ashmunên, Medinet, and the rest, serve
the same purpose. The ruins of the past are thus valued by the
agriculturist not less than by the archæologist, perhaps even more
so; for lands in proximity to them are rented higher in
consequence. Year by year more attention is now paid to the
dressing of the soil, as perennial irrigation is more understood
and more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span> studied;
besides the natural resources of the country, an increasing amount
of manures is imported from abroad, and there is little doubt that
the growing tendency in this direction will continue.</p>

<p>But all preparation of the soil is worse than useless labour
unless the necessary amount of water can be provided. This amount
varies both with the nature of the crop, the season of the year,
and the position of the land. The critical time is, of course, the
summer, when the supply of water is least and the heat is greatest,
and, of course, in Upper Egypt, where the sun is strongest, and the
loss by evaporation consequently greater, the demand is more urgent
than in the Delta.</p>

<p>The total amount of cultivable land in Egypt is 6,250,000 acres.
Before the completion of the new works, to which period all the
figures in this chapter refer, the total nominally under
cultivation was about 5,750,000 acres. Of this, Upper Egypt claimed
2,320,000—viz., 587,000 nominally under perennial irrigation, and
1,732,000, including 1,435,000 under basin irrigation every year,
and 297,000 of Nile berms, which are only flooded once in six or
seven years, and at other times irrigated directly from the Nile by
means of shadoofs and water-wheels. Of the whole of this area only
about 20 to 30 per cent. produce double crops in the year; for the
amount of perennial irrigation is but small, and, although the
whole of the Fayoum—329,000 acres—was supposed to be perennially
irrigated, so faulty was the water-supply that the summer crops
were only about 30 per cent. of the whole, instead of 50 per cent.,
which is the rule<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> in
the Delta. It seems, indeed, as though matters had been arranged
expressly for the benefit of the tourist; it is Upper Egypt in the
winter season that he goes to see, and it is then that the fields
are green with corn, clover, and other crops. The following table
shows the different crops, and the acreage devoted to them at the
different seasons in Upper Egypt:</p>

</table>

<p>In Lower Egypt, or the Delta, the total area of fully or partly
cultivated land is 3,430,000 acres, and there are still 500,000
acres of totally unreclaimed land. All this is under perennial
irrigation; half of it is under summer crops every year, and 40 per
cent. produces two crops a year. The following is a similar table
to that given for Upper Egypt:</p>

</table>

<p>Even if we look only to the summer acreage under crops, it is
obvious that the water-supply in the summer is very important; but
when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> look to the
value of the crop it becomes much more striking. Far the most
valuable crop in Egypt is the cotton, which is the principal item
in the summer. In Upper Egypt the value of a summer crop is, on the
average, more than twice that of a winter crop per acre, and in the
Delta the proportion is nearly the same. And though the value of
the flood crops is increased by the date-palms, of which there are
5,700,000 paying taxes in Egypt, and whose produce is gathered at
this season, it cannot be compared with the summer crops.
Sugar-cane is now but little grown in the Delta, and even in Upper
Egypt its acreage is rather less than that of cotton.</p>

<p>Valuable as are the cotton-plant and the sugar-cane, it must
never be forgotten that one of the humbler winter crops, though
valued much lower in point of money, is yet the foundation of
well-being in the others—I mean the Egyptian clover, or bersine,
the friend of beast and man alike. Long before I knew its
remarkable properties, I admired it for its beauty. Green and
glossy, it covers acre upon acre with a luxuriant carpet, in
pleasing contrast both to the black soil and the desert sand, and
most refreshing and comforting to the eye. A bundle of it will
satisfy even the grumbling camel; even the melancholy buffalo looks
a shade less depressed when her turn comes to be tethered in it for
her meal. Sheep and donkeys can hardly eat it down fast enough
within the circle of their ropes before it has grown up again. And
all the time it is steadily collecting in the soil the invaluable
globules of nitrate, which will put new life into the succeeding
cotton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span> or corn. The
part it plays in preparing the soil can be estimated by the
rotations of crops followed by the Egyptian cultivator. These are
as follows:</p>

</table>

<p>Rice and barley have their place, because they are less affected
by the injurious salts, which are the great enemies of the soil’s
fertility.</p>

<p>In Lower Egypt cotton is sown from the end of February to the
beginning of April. The land is well watered before it is ploughed
for the seed, and again when the seed is sown. From then until the
beginning of the flood it is watered on the average about once in
twenty days. The harvest lasts from August 20 to November 10, and
the cotton is picked two or three times over. During this time the
crop is watered about once in every fifteen days, but as the water
is now abundant there is nothing to fear. Indian corn is sown from
July 5 to August 30, and October 15 to November 30 is the period of
harvest. It is irrigated at the time of sowing, twenty days after,
and then once in ten or twelve days. The first two of these
waterings are, of course, the important ones. The earlier it is
sown, the better the crop<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_41">[41]</span> will be, because it will have better weather
for maturing; but if the flood is late, and consequently the
water-supply is low, the Government may have to resort to a system
of rotations in sending water down the canals, and then the Indian
corn crop may be sacrificed to the interests of the cotton. Rice is
the wettest of all the crops; the kind (called ‘sultâni’) sown in
May and reaped in November is watered once in ten days before the
flood, but during the flood is given as much water as the drains
can carry off. The other kind (called ‘sabaini’) is sown in August,
and also reaped in November. Both in Lower and Upper Egypt it is
purely a flood crop, and takes all the water it can get. The winter
crops, wheat, beans, barley, and clover, are sown in November and
December. Wheat and beans are irrigated twice, barley once, but
clover goes on growing up till June, and takes more water according
to the number of crops, sometimes three or four, that are taken off
it.</p>

<p>In Upper Egypt cotton-sowing begins at the same time, but the
harvest is earlier. Sugar-cane is sown in March, and the canes are
cut from December 15 to March 15. Sometimes the same roots are left
in the ground, and produce another crop in the second year; but
this is never of such quality as the first, and the land has
probably to be left fallow after it. Sugar, therefore, though
nominally more valuable than cotton per acre, is more costly in the
long-run. It is watered every twelve or fifteen days. The other
crops are the summer and flood sorghum, grown on the berms or in
tracts within the basins, and irrigated by shadoofs and
water-wheels about once every ten<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_42">[42]</span> days; and the wheat, beans, clover, and
barley, in the basins. The cereals are usually not watered at all,
but the clover follows the same course as in Lower Egypt.</p>

<p>Summing up these results, we find that the principal crops in
Lower Egypt are cotton and rice. The cotton needs irrigation about
once in twenty days, the rice once in ten days. To provide this
amount of water, a canal should discharge (after allowance has been
made for wastage) 22 cubic metres in twenty-four hours per acre of
cotton, and 40 cubic metres per acre of rice. That is to say, 1
cubic metre per second will suffice for 4,000 acres of cotton and
2,150 acres of rice. In Upper Egypt rice is only a flood crop, and
cotton and sugar need about 25 to 30 per cent. more water than in
the Delta, owing to the greater loss from evaporation—that is to
say, 1 cubic metre per second will only suffice for 3,000 acres of
cotton or sugar. During the winter the land throughout Egypt
requires on the average a watering once in forty days. But, as we
have seen, it is the summer supply for the cotton that is the
really important thing. We shall see later what the effect of the
reservoir is likely to be in safeguarding and extending these
interests.</p>

<span class="less">THE DELTA BARRAGE AND THE ENGLISH
ENGINEERS</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">At</span> the date of the English
occupation the Delta Barrage was generally thought to be like the
whole fabric of Egyptian Government, rotten to the core. And so
indeed it seemed. No one had ever dared to use, or apparently even
to think of using, the Barrage on the Damietta or right-hand branch
at all. The history of the Barrage on the Rosetta branch was hardly
less inglorious. In 1863 its gates were closed for the first time,
but about ten of its arches began to settle, and ominous cracks
showed. Eventually the threatened part was surrounded by a
coffer-dam, and from 1872 to 1883 it managed to hold up about 1
metre. But even that was precarious. Commission after Commission
had condemned the structure; it was felt that at any moment it
might give way, especially if called upon to bear a greater strain,
and it was actually the settled policy of the Government to rely on
huge and costly pumping-stations instead. It was a paltry result
after the expenditure of £4,000,000 and so much labour.</p>

<p>Then, not for the first or last time, the Anglo-Indians came to
the rescue of Africa. Sir Evelyn<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_44">[44]</span> Baring himself (now Lord Cromer) during his
service as Financial Member of the Council in India, must have been
impressed by the enormous importance of irrigation. It would not be
difficult to find many points of resemblance between his character
and that of one of the greatest, if not the greatest, of the rulers
of India, Lord Lawrence, different as were their spheres of work;
but certainly they were alike in this. As Lord Lawrence supported
Arthur Cotton in his engineering work, so Lord Cromer supported
Colin Scott-Moncrieff and the band of trusty lieutenants—Willcocks,
Garstin, Ross, Brown, Foster, Western, and Reid—who came with him.
Fortunately for Egypt, these men, trained in the best school of
irrigation in the world, possessed not only the highest scientific
skill and knowledge, but were also animated by the best spirit of
the empire-building Englishman. Deep in them lay the earnest wish
and determination, far stronger even than their enthusiasm and love
for their profession, to alleviate the lot of the unhappy peasantry
of Egypt. It was this heartfelt sympathy for the wrongs of the
fellaheen, ground down by the intolerable burden of the corvée,
that sustained them in their ceaseless labours and enabled them to
pass successfully through those dark days, when the air was full of
forebodings of failure and disaster, whose fulfilment would have
pleased so many.</p>

<p>The Barrage is situated, as has been said, a little way back
from the point of the Delta. It is really two Barrages, one on the
left or Rosetta branch of the Nile, with sixty-one arches, 465
metres in length, and the other on the Damietta branch
with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span> seventy-one
arches, 535 metres in length. Between the two runs a revetment wall
across the intervening tongue of land, 1,000 metres in length. From
a distance it resembles a bridge of rather fanciful design, with
the arches set unusually close together, and, indeed, for a great
part of its career the functions of a bridge were the only ones it
performed. The tongue of land between has been converted into
beautiful gardens, planted with shady trees and many shrubs and
flowers, and even a greensward resembling grass. Altogether, it is
one of the most delightful and beautiful spots in Egypt, besides
being one of the most useful. Here is the starting-point of the
great feeder canals which irrigate the Delta provinces. On the
left, facing north, is the Rayah Behera, which supplies the
province of Behera, to the left of the Rosetta branch. Between the
two Barrages is the head of the Rayah Menoufia, the canal which
feeds the two provinces of Menoufia and Gharbia, lying between the
two arms of the river; while on the right is the Rayah Tewfiki,
which, with its supplementary canals, Ismailia, Sharkia, and
Basusia, supplies the three eastern provinces of the Delta,
Kalyubia, Sharkia, and Dakalia. All these canals are navigable, as
well as the branches of the river, and provided with locks for that
purpose. These great waterways are free to all, and few of the
results of British occupation are more appreciated in Egypt.
Formerly all craft upon the Nile had to pay toll on passing under a
bridge, which did nothing but hinder their progress, while those
for whose convenience it was made passed without charge
overhead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>A Barrage, as its
name implies, is designed to completely bar the bed of the river,
so as to enable it to feed the canals at a higher level than would
otherwise be the case, and also to allow the flood to pass through
it easily. It needs, therefore, a very solid foundation from bank
to bank, on which the arches which hold the movable sluice-gates
can be securely planted. Its construction is, therefore, a very
different and much more difficult matter than merely throwing a
bridge over the stream, even a bridge with several spans. The
difficulty is all the greater when, as here, the bed of the river
offers nothing more substantial than shifting sands to build upon.
It was for this reason that Linant wished to build the Barrages at
leisure in the dry, and then divert the river from its old
channels, and lead it through when they were completed. But Mougel
chose to build his in the existing bed of the river, thereby
increasing the difficulties of actual construction, though from
other points of view there was much to be said for this plan. At
the site of the Rosetta Barrage the bed of the river was not of
uniform depth; he therefore filled up the deepest part of the
channel, which lay on the right, with loose stones, so as to bring
it up to the level of the bottom on the left-hand side. No cement
was used in laying down this barrier, but the Nile mud filled the
interstices and made it water-tight; when finished, this barrier
was 60 metres wide and 10 deep at the deepest part. On this and on
the natural sand he built a platform 46 metres in width and 3·5
metres thick, composed of concrete overlaid with brick and
stonework. On the platform he raised his arches and piers,
all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> built of brick.
Each of the openings for the sluice-gates, sixty-one in number, was
5 metres wide. Like an iceberg, that part of the Barrage which is
visible above water is much less than the invisible part below. To
further strengthen the structure and keep it in its place, a mass
of rubble pitching or loose stones was thrown into the river on the
downstream side. This talus was 3 to 16 metres in depth, and at one
part extended 50 metres downstream in a kind of tongue, narrowing
down to 2 metres. The Damietta Barrage was built on a similar plan,
but its downstream talus was not so large. Unfortunately, the
concrete used for the platform was inferior, chiefly owing to the
fact that Mehemet Ali, growing impatient at the slow progress of
the work, ordered a certain amount of material to be laid down
every day, and laid down it had to be in defiance of all
engineering requirements. The consequence was that, as soon as the
Rosetta Barrage was subjected to strain, ten of the arches on the
left-hand side, where the platform was laid down on sand only,
settled and cracked. It was patched up by surrounding the injured
arches with a coffer-dam; but the Damietta Barrage never even had
its gates put in.</p>

<p>Such was the structure with which the English engineers had to
deal. Even as it stands to-day, it cannot, of course, compare in
magnitude with many works upon the Indian rivers; but as regards
the difficulties to be overcome, it can compare with almost any in
the world. It would have been far easier to rebuild the whole thing
from the beginning, but at the time the necessary funds were
not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> forthcoming. They
had to take the old structure, with all its imperfections, and
screw it up to work as it was. The country could not afford to cut
off the summer water-supply of the Delta while the repairs were in
progress. The cotton-crop had always to be thought of. And the
period of the year during which the summer canals required to be
supplied was the only period during which work could be done, for
once the flood came down all operations were at an end. It is the
glory of the English engineers that, working under these conditions
and with untrained workmen, they succeeded in their task.</p>

<p>The Government was already paying many thousands a year to a
company for pumping water out of the Rosetta branch into the canals
during the summer, and the first thing Sir Colin Scott Moncrieff
had to do on his arrival was to decide upon a scheme which had been
prepared for erecting new pumping-stations at an initial expense of
about three-quarters of a million, and involving an annual
expenditure of at least another quarter of a million. So hopeless
were the prospects of the Barrage assumed to be, that even this
expenditure, with a doubtful result, was thought preferable to
repairing it. Sir Colin’s arrival was only in the nick of time. He
determined to see what could be done with the resources at hand.
The new pumping-station scheme was set aside, and Mr. Willcocks was
put in charge of the Barrage.</p>

<p>There was much literature on the subject. During the last
sixteen years nothing had been done, but much had been written, and
more said. Commissions, expert and inexpert, had issued<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> voluminous and condemnatory
reports, and had even prepared expensive schemes of repair. Mr.
Willcocks (now Sir William) is an indefatigable reader, and could
hardly have been encouraged thereby, till an examination of the
structure itself showed that all the later reports had been drawn
up without reference to facts. It had been observed that whenever
the gates were let down there was very severe action of the water
on the downstream side. The authors of the reports concluded that
the foundations were honeycombed. It is characteristic of the
Looking-glass days of Ismail that no one ever thought of trying to
find out by actual observation whether there might not be some
other cause. But Mr. Willcocks, looking for himself, found that
this action of the water was caused, not by honeycombed
foundations, but by open gratings which intervened between the
bottom of the sluice-gates and the platform. They had been put down
originally to keep the silt away from the bottom of the gates.
Someone had fixed them so as to prevent the gates from being
lowered to their full extent and then they had actually been
forgotten. Measures were at once taken to close these gratings, and
eventually to remove them altogether. 20,000 cubic metres of rubble
pitching were added to the talus. The Damietta Barrage was likewise
strengthened with various ingenious expedients, improvised to meet
the demands of the moment. Sluice-gates were put in for the first
time and gradually closed. Part of it was closed by a temporary
stone dam. Eventually in the summer of 1884 2·2 metres of water
were held up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> on the
Rosetta branch, and 1 metre on the Damietta. Next year the same
nursing process was continued. The coffer-dam round the weak arches
was strengthened, the talus of rubble pitching below each Barrage
was completed, and this year 3 metres were held up on the Rosetta
branch and 1·6 on the Damietta. The effect was extraordinary. The
acreage under summer cultivation was doubled, rising from 600,000
to 1,200,000 acres. Not only was the supply of water in the Delta
canals greatly increased throughout the summer, but, as it was
delivered at a higher level, there was a great saving of expense in
lifting it on to the land. For the first time the Egyptians
thoroughly realized that a new power had come amongst them.</p>

<p>The experiment had been successful, but temporary expedients
could not last for ever. The more water held up, and the greater
the area of the summer cultivation, the more necessary it became to
insure the stability of the structure. A thorough repair would cost
money. Fortunately, this was now forthcoming. Mr. Willcocks’
success had settled the claim of the Barrage to a share in the
famous Irrigation Million borrowed in 1885.</p>

<p>At the end of 1886 the work was begun, under the charge of
Colonel Western and Mr. Reid, sent specially from India for the
purpose. The operations were spread over four years. In the first
year the left half of the Rosetta Barrage was taken in hand and
finished before the flood, next year the right half. In 1889 and
1890 the Damietta Barrage was similarly taken in hand and finished.
Each year the part to be repaired was<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_51">[51]</span> enclosed by earthen dams, and the water
pumped out so as to lay the foundations dry. The whole of the
existing floor was raised, both on the upstream and downstream
side, and it was also considerably lengthened. It was, in fact,
enclosed in a new and reliable suit of armour. The dangers and
anxieties of the work were incessant. The protecting dams were
always liable to be breached. Spring after spring burst out through
the treacherous bed of the river, and threatened the destruction of
the year’s work; and again and again each of them was successively
stopped by a number of ingenious devices. There is no enemy so
persistent and so insidious in its attacks as running water. It is
always feeling for and finding out the weak spots. It never sleeps
or slackens by day or by night. It can only be met successfully by
a corresponding activity. While work was possible, it was carried
on unceasingly by night as well as by day. Sometimes as many as
1,600 men worked through the night. The upper brickwork was
generally sound, but new iron sluice-gates moving in special
grooves were fitted throughout. The whole of the repairs cost
£465,000. It was money well laid out. Not only was the safety of
the Barrage assured, but it was found possible to hold up yet
another metre of water. The area of summer crops matured rose once
more from 1,200,000 to 1,520,000.</p>

<p>It might have been thought that the work was now complete. Both
in 1891 and 1892 (a year of specially low summer supply) all the
water in the Nile was held up, and diverted into the canals. Not a
drop reached the sea during the summer<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_52">[52]</span> without having done duty. But the engineers
were now looking forward to a time when the supply would be greatly
increased. The idea of a reservoir had become an affair of
practical politics. It was necessary to make assurance doubly sure.
Accordingly, in 1896 a new experiment was tried—namely,
stock-ramming with clay.</p>

<p>Certain arches in the Damietta Barrage were selected, and in
them five-inch holes were bored right down through pier and
platform alike. When the bore-holes were complete, they were lined
with iron tubes. Clay was then forced through the tube by means of
an iron rammer, and as much as could be made to spread out at the
bottom of the hole was put in and rammed. As far as the clay went,
the experiment was not an entire success; but the boring brought to
light a condition of things in the very vitals of the Barrage which
demanded drastic treatment, for the bore-holes proved the existence
of large cavities in the original platform, and in some places
there was free water communication between one bore-hole and
another. Some piers in the Rosetta Barrage were therefore chosen
for a similar experiment, but this time liquid Portland cement was
used instead of clay, and the results were entirely satisfactory.
Few discoveries have been of more signal service than the invention
of Portland cement. It is not too much to say that it has
revolutionized hydraulic engineering by the facilities it affords
for constructing solid works in water. Its strength and resisting
power is enormous, but its greatest quality is that it hardens and
solidifies under the action of water, and, so far as is known, only
goes on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> getting
harder and harder with time. The borings in the Rosetta Barrage
having revealed similar deficiencies to those in the Damietta, it
was decided to apply to both a thorough dose of this invaluable and
invigorating medicine.</p>

<p>In 1897 five holes were bored in each pier of the Rosetta
Barrage (their united length amounted to very nearly 6 kilometres),
and into each was poured a quantity of liquid cement. The necessity
for the treatment was proved by the fact that in some cases the
cement travelled right through from the bore-hole in one pier and
rose through the bore-hole in an adjoining pier till it reached the
top. One pier actually swallowed 439 barrels of cement, while its
neighbour took a lesser but still gigantic draught of 327 barrels.
There was no doubt that the cement thoroughly explored and filled
all the cavities existing in the foundations under the bridge. In
all, 3,254 barrels were used in the Rosetta Barrage alone. In 1898
the grouting process, as it is called, was applied with equal
success to the Damietta Barrage.</p>

<p>To use Sir Hanbury Brown’s homely but expressive image, the
process applied to the Barrage was exactly that followed by a cook
who wishes to finish off a cold pie with its proper complement of
jelly. The jelly is introduced into the pie in the form of warm
gravy, which penetrates into and fills every recess of the
succulent interior, and then solidifies as it cools.</p>

<p>And still the engineers were not satisfied. So treacherous is
the river’s bed that no possible safeguards seemed superfluous. It
speaks volumes for the courage and skill of those who in
1885<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> held up 3 metres
of water with the old unreformed Barrage, that in 1897, after the
successful execution of such great and costly repairs, it was still
thought advisable to undertake completely new works to assist in
the task of holding up 4, or at the most 5, metres.</p>

<p>It is a principle in hydraulics, not easily understood at first
by the layman, that the pressure upon a weir or barrage in a river
depends entirely upon the difference in level between the water on
the upstream and on the downstream side, and not on the mere volume
of water in the river behind it. In December, 1897, the Caisse de
la Dette voted £530,000 for the construction of two subsidiary
downstream weirs, with the object of relieving the pressure on the
Barrage by raising the level of the water on the downstream side,
thus dividing the head of water to be held up into two—in other
words, by making two steps instead of one. Each weir was to consist
of a core of rubble masonry set in cement, sunk well below the bed
of the river, and protected up and down stream by a long slope of
rough stone blocks or pitching. To make the masonry core thoroughly
watertight, a mass of clay puddle was to be put on either side of
it. The weirs were thus to be a solid dam, blocking the course of
the stream up to such a height that the head of water on the
Barrage, at that time amounting to 4 metres, would be reduced to
2·5 metres. The flood would pass freely over the top of the weirs.
At the same time the sluice-gates of the existing Barrage were to
be heightened, so as to permit the upstream level to be raised 1
metre more in June and July,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_55">[55]</span> so as to take full advantage of the rising
flood and facilitate the early sowing of maize, a great point with
the Egyptian cultivator.</p>

<p>By the summer of 1900 this programme had been completed. The
building of the weir on the Rosetta branch was an especially fine
performance, for which great credit was due to Sir Hanbury Brown
and Mr. Brooke, who were in charge of it. Five hundred metres in
length, it was begun at the end of December, 1899, and actually
finished before the flood began to come down in July. The same
Portland cement played a great part in its construction. It may now
fairly be said that the Barrage is complete at last, and fully
equal to every strain that it can be called upon to bear.</p>

<p>The weirs were constructed not a moment too soon. It so happened
that the summer supply of 1900 was lower than in any previous year
of which records have been kept. In 1889 the river sank to a level
of ·60 metre below zero on the Assouan gauge. In 1878 it fell to
·71 metre below zero, and this was the lowest known before the
summer of 1900. But on three days in that year, May 15, 16, and 26,
the river fell to a level of ·91 metre below zero. The position was
aggravated by the extension of summer cultivation. The total extent
of summer crops had risen still further to over 1,700,000
acres.</p>

<p>To save the valuable cotton crop was the earnest preoccupation
of the Irrigation Department. They were able by the most strenuous
efforts, not merely to save the crop, but so to treat it that it
gave a yield which, only a few years before, would have been
considered perfectly impossible even in a good<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_56">[56]</span> year. But all their efforts would have
been in vain had it not been possible, thanks to the new weirs, to
raise the level of the water upstream of the Barrage to an extent
which would have been exceedingly dangerous without their
assistance, and so to take full advantage of the rising flood. The
mere enumeration of the special measures which were put into force
gives a very good idea of the difficult duties which devolve on
those who control the water in Egypt:</p>

<p>1. Earthen dams were constructed in both branches of the river
to prevent the inrush of salt water from the sea.</p>

<p>2. Special programmes were laid down for ‘rotations’ on the
canals.</p>

<p>The system of rotations, which was introduced from India, is
that the land-owners are only allowed to pump water on to their
lands at certain intervals. There are several advantages in this.
The water is economized, and as it can thereby be kept at a lower
level in the canals, there is less danger of the soil becoming
deteriorated by excessive saturation. The pumps are allowed to work
for a certain period, according to the district, and then an
interval is prescribed, until the expiration of which they are not
allowed to work again. In 1900 the pumps were allowed to work for a
period of six days at a time, and at first twelve days was the
interval until the next pumping. But as the summer wore on, and the
river continued to fall, the interval was gradually extended to
twenty-two days—a very severe measure indeed.</p>

<p>3. All land-owners were warned not to sow rice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>4. They were also
forbidden to sow maize until a date should be announced.</p>

<p>5. Special pumping arrangements were made.</p>

<p>6. There was more than usually careful regulation at the heads
of the canals above the Barrage, so as to insure a proper
distribution of the water available to all the provinces.</p>

<p>7. A special staff was appointed to see that all these
regulations were carried out.</p>

<p>Could any government be more paternal than this—it might even be
said, more despotic? But countries which depend on irrigation have
a natural tendency towards despotism. When water is plentiful they
may be as republican and democratic as you please; but when the
crisis of scanty water comes they must have a strong hand over
them, just as the Roman Republic had to have its Dictator in times
of national peril. It speaks well for the good sense of the
Egyptians, and it proves their implicit faith, built up by sixteen
years’ experience, in the English engineers, that even those
stringent regulations were unhesitatingly obeyed, and that breaches
of them were so rare as to be almost non-existent. They had their
reward; for while 1878 is still remembered as a year of black
disaster and distress, in 1900 the cotton crop amounted to no less
than 5,250,000 kantars,<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5"
class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and the maize crop, in spite of its late
sowing, was also very good. Only the rice, a comparatively
insignificant item, was sacrificed to its more important rivals.
Thanks mainly to the good work done by the completed Barrage,
neither the public nor the private finances of Egypt<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> suffered the least shock from a
year of unprecedented scarcity of water, even when this was coupled
with most unseasonable cold and fogs in September, which
considerably diminished the output of cotton. Lord Cromer had
indeed good reason to write in 1901:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>‘Had it not been for the labours of the eminent hydraulic
engineers, who for the last seventeen years have placed their
services at the disposal of the Egyptian Government, the most
skilful financial assistance would not have availed both to place
the Egyptian Treasury in a position of assured solvency and to meet
in any adequate degree the constant demands which are the necessary
accompaniment of a policy of reform.’</p>
</div>

<p>Such are the outlines of the long history of the Barrage,
designed by Frenchmen and brought to perfection by Englishmen. Both
nations can share in the credit of the work, and it is pleasant to
record once more the generous and graceful act by which the chief
of the English engineers recognised and acknowledged the merits of
his predecessor. Sir Colin Scott Moncrieff discovered Mougel Bey
living in obscurity and oblivion, weighed down by poverty and
neglect. It was owing to his intercession that the poor old man was
rescued from want, and, by means of a pension granted by the
Egyptian Government, enabled to spend his remaining days in comfort
and honour. Both nations are entitled to be proud of this act of
poetic justice, which added a lustre of its own to the glory of the
completed Barrage.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span><a id=
"c06"></a>CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="less">THE CORVÉE</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">From</span> time immemorial the
peasantry of Egypt have been liable to the corvée in some form or
other. In a country depending for its existence upon the proper
maintenance of its dykes, it was only natural that the whole
population should turn out to perform the necessary work. But a
useful custom very easily degenerated into a galling slavery under
Oriental despotism. Rulers with absolute power of life and death
over their subjects, who regarded the land they ruled as their own
personal property, could not be expected to make much distinction
between works carried out for the general good and those designed
merely for their own convenience and aggrandisement. The Pyramids
and others of the mighty remains of ancient Egypt stand as
monuments of the greatness of the Pharaohs, but no less of the
miseries of countless generations under the system of forced
labour, which is known in our time as the corvée, a term applied
sometimes to the forced labour itself, and sometimes to those who
perform it.</p>

<p>In the early chapters of the Book of Exodus there is a brief but
pregnant description of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_60">[60]</span> sufferings of the Israelites when subjected
to the burden.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>‘And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with
rigour:</p>

<p>‘And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter,
and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their
service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.’</p>

<p>‘And Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their
officers, saying, Ye shall no more give the people straw to make
brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye
shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof. Let there
more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein.’</p>

<p>‘And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works,
your daily tasks, as when there was straw. And the officers of the
children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them,
were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your
task in making bricks both yesterday and to-day, as
heretofore?’</p>

<p>‘And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they
were in evil case.’</p>

<p>‘And the Lord said, I have also heard the groaning of the
children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage.’</p>

<p>‘But the children of Israel hearkened not unto Moses for anguish
of spirit, and for cruel bondage.’</p>
</div>

<p>Doubtless the amount of forced labour varied from time to time,
according to the ambition or the caprice of the rulers of the
country. But the annual necessity for watching the dykes during the
flood, and repairing them when it was over, never permitted the
custom to fall into disuse, and the knowledge that this great
instrument was always ready to hand must have been a powerful
incentive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> to any King
or Caliph who wished to send his name down to history as the author
of a mighty work. No wonder that after so many centuries of
practice the Egyptians are the most patient and efficient
spade-workers in the world. The wretched peasantry of Egypt must
have blessed the accession of the undistinguished Sovereigns who
had no desire to add to their fame either by building at home or by
conquest abroad. To them the glories of a Rameses or an Amenemhat
must have been small compensation for their ‘anguish of spirit and
cruel bondage.’</p>

<p>So long as basin irrigation continued to be universal, there was
much to be said on behalf of the corvée, if the system was justly
and impartially administered. During the months of the flood, and
those preceding it, when the land was lying dry and baked, there
was little or nothing for the agricultural population to do except
to clear the shallow flood canals, repair the dykes, and protect
the river-banks. If the labour was compulsory, it was, at any rate,
everybody’s interest to perform it. The work lay at their own door;
they were not dragged away to a distant province. There must always
have been abuses in practice. The humbler folk did more than their
share, and so on, but in theory it was not bad.</p>

<p>All this was changed with the introduction of perennial
irrigation and the digging of the summer canals. Owing to their
depth, and sometimes, also, to their faulty construction, the silt
deposits in them were very great, and the whole corvée was called
out to clear them, though very few were interested in them. More
than that, a man’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
own home was no longer the scene of his labours. The labourers of
one province were called in to work in another. Each year the
corvée worked from January 15 to July 15, clearing the canals and
repairing the banks. From August 1 to November 1 they guarded the
Nile banks in the flood. Every year an extensive programme of work
was sketched out, but before it was finished they had to hurry off
to flood-protection duty. Not only unpaid, they had to find their
own tools, and provide their own commissariat, a double hardship on
men out of their own neighbourhood. During the flood, when they
lived in booths built for themselves on the Nile banks, they had to
find their own lanterns, and even, like the Israelites of old,
their own straw and brushwood, to save the dykes from the action of
the waves. New works were carried out in the same fashion.</p>

<p>Nor was this the sum of their grievances. The increase of summer
irrigation made the months immediately preceding the flood a very
busy instead of a very slack time of year. The value of the cotton
crop made everyone most anxious to secure it, so the larger
proprietors kept their tenants at home for that purpose. The
numbers of the corvée decreased, and the burden of it fell more and
more upon the poor fellaheen. Ministers and high officials from the
Khedive downwards employed the corvée to work on their own private
estates. Other persons, influential by station or by bribery,
secured the like advantage, and robbed their humble neighbours of
their labour, their last remaining possession. Under Said Pasha the
corvée dug the Suez Canal. Under Ismail they<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_63">[63]</span> dug the Ibrahimiyah Canal, the sole object
of which was to benefit his private estates in Upper Egypt. Even
the splendid carriage-road that runs from Cairo to the Pyramids of
Gizeh was raised on the same foundations that the Empress Eugénie
might travel there in comfort after the opening of the Suez
Canal.</p>

<p>Only a nation inured to slavery could have endured it. Many,
indeed, labouring under the burning sun, unpaid, unfed, and
unclothed, succumbed. But what did that matter when other human
beasts of burden were there to take their place? The activity of
the survivors was kept up by the whip, the traditional motive-power
in Egypt. Nominally, all between the ages of fifteen and fifty were
liable to serve, but there were a multitude of exceptions,
including teachers, holy men, students, certain classes of
tradesmen, and others. The law of 1881 laid down that anyone might
exempt himself by providing a substitute or by paying a cash
ransom. But as there was no penalty imposed for not paying, every
man of any position freed himself from the obligation without
paying the tax, and the whole burden of the corvée fell more than
ever on the poorer classes. The régime of the kurbash, or whip, and
the grosser abuses of the system, vanished immediately upon the
English occupation, but all the earthwork maintenance was still
performed by this unpaid labour.</p>

<p>It was, as I have said, the spectacle of the dumb misery of the
fellaheen that particularly stimulated the English engineers in
their task of repairing the Barrage. The first relief came
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> 1884, when the
Nile was held up to a higher level at the Barrage. This had a
twofold effect, for the canals did not require to be cleared to so
great depth; and the higher level of the water enabled them to be
laid on a better slope, which diminished the deposit of silt. In
fact, the partial use of the Barrage in 1884 reduced the amount of
silt deposit by 26 per cent. In 1885 the first step was also taken
in a new direction: £30,000 were advanced towards the experiment of
clearing some canals in the provinces of Menoufia and Gharbiah by
contract. As usual, the gloomiest forebodings were uttered on every
side. It was said the fellaheen would not work voluntarily. The
whip alone was the only stimulus to which they were sensible. The
experiment was bound to fail.</p>

<p>Once more the croakers were wrong. The fellah justified the
confidence of Mr. Willcocks and his colleagues, that he was not
unlike other men, and would work gladly for a wage. And so the
struggle for emancipation went on with increased vigour. In 1886
£250,000 were provided by the Caisse for the reduction of the
corvée, so that while in 1883 107,000 men had been called out in
the Delta alone, in 1887 the number had been reduced to 27,500.
Finally, December, 1889, saw the last of the system, and the
performance of earthwork maintenance by the corvée was finally
abolished. The Government supplemented the £250,000 a year received
from the Caisse by another £150,000. In former days the labour
required to clear the canals was estimated in the Delta alone at
£530,000. For the sum of £400,000 Egypt got rid of the burden
throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span> the whole
country. It was a bargain well worth making at a far higher cost.
No greater boon could have been conferred upon the fellaheen. No
longer are their lives made ‘bitter with hard bondage, in morter,
and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field.’ That
‘evil case’ is ended. They labour indeed, but it is voluntary
labour, without ‘groaning and anguish of spirit.’</p>

<p>The Government, of course, retains the right to call out the
corvée in case of any grave national emergency, and every year,
too, it is called out to guard the banks in flood-time. But the
flood-corvée is cheerfully borne. It entails no hardship on the
people. Its incidence, too, has been very much diminished, as the
following figures show (the period of service is 150 days):</p>

<p>The figures tell their own tale. Experience and good
organization have enormously decreased the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_66">[66]</span> number of men called out, so that it is now
but a very slight burden upon the people. The date of calling out
has also been altered to August 15 instead of August 1. The
possession of the Soudan, and an accurate record of the state of
the gauges in those regions, will also assist in making more
accurate forecasts of the nature of the flood. In 1900 more men
were called out than were required, because the flood came down
early and promised to be a high one, but failed to fulfil
expectations. The levels in the Soudan were known, but, there being
no previous experience to judge them by, no inferences could be
drawn from them. But the Soudan readings will be more and more
useful as time goes on.</p>

<p>But even apart from this, there is great hope of a steady
diminution in the numbers called out, and even that, except in
years of high flood, the corvée may not be required at all. The
record of the year 1901 is of remarkable promise in this respect.
North of Cairo no corvée was called out at all, for the first time
in the history of Egypt. The flood was low, but not exceptionally
low. In any year Upper Egypt is responsible for far the greater
number, and this is largely due to the extent of the basin banks
which have to be guarded. It is remarkable that the two districts
in which the greatest number were called out were in charge of
native Egyptian inspectors, who were no doubt influenced by the old
tradition that vast numbers of men should be employed. At any rate,
as perennial irrigation increases in Upper Egypt, fewer men will be
required, concurrently with the disuse of the basin dykes. And it
seems likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span> that in
years to come the whole task will be performed by contract labour;
though the power of calling out the corvée will always be held in
reserve in case of any specially dangerous flood. But in such a
case the difficulty will be rather to prevent the work from being
hindered by excessive numbers. There will be no doubt of the
willingness to serve of practically the whole population.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span><a id=
"c07"></a>CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="less">RESERVOIR PRELIMINARIES</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">In</span> dealing with the history
of the Barrage I have somewhat anticipated the order of events. It
was the prospect of the coming Reservoir and an increased
water-supply in summer that urged on the engineers to make
assurance doubly sure by placing the strength of that structure
beyond all doubt. It is time to pass from the Delta to Assouan.</p>

<p>No country in the world tells its story more readily to the
traveller than Upper Egypt. As he passes up the broad waterway of
the Nile, he may survey the whole life of the land without stirring
from the deck of his steamer. If he has been in Egypt before, he
cannot fail to be struck by the growth of its prosperity; it forces
itself upon him in the bearing of the people, and in the number of
their flocks and herds, now as ever the outward and visible sign of
material well-being. Even the squalid clusters of mud huts, often
roofless, or covered only by a few loose canes, dirty and miserable
as they seem to Western eyes, with nothing substantial among them
except the tomb of some sheikh or the inevitable pigeon-houses, are
only proofs of the genial climate, which makes a<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> roof overhead, and clothing as
well, among the least of the necessities of life. The people
themselves, hard workers as they are, have a happy and prosperous
aspect, and the crowds of naked children, brown as the waters by
whose edge they play, look as cheerful and contented as the vast
colonies of pigeons, which live under very similar conditions to
their owners.</p>

<p>On each side of the river-valley, here and there, especially on
the eastern side, coming right to the water’s edge, rise the hills
of the desert. Where the domain of the water ceases a man may stand
with one foot in the bare and barren sand and the other in the most
fertile soil in the world. Everywhere along the bank, hour after
hour, day after day, the traveller may see the peasants lifting the
water with the primitive shadoofs, tier upon tier, up to the level
of the fields, or the oxen turning the sakieh. A hundred times a
day he will have borne in upon him the fact that all he sees, from
the kid upon the dykes to those obelisks of modern Egypt, the tall
chimneys of the sugar factories, owes its existence absolutely to
the water. Close behind the teeming villages and the luxuriant
crops, the palm-trees and the acacias, the sugar-canes and the
maize-fields, rise the gaunt limestone rocks and the sandy desert,
fit emblems of the famine that is ever ready to swoop down should
the water fail.</p>

<p>Even as late as December, steaming up the 550 miles of river,
often half a mile or more across, between Cairo and Assouan,
against the strong current, watching the majestic sweep of those
wide waters pouring irresistibly towards the sea, it is<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> hard to realize the anxiety of
later months. But May or June has a very different tale to tell. To
take and store the precious water, which now during the flood and
winter rushes down in untold volume, to be lost and squandered in
the sea, and use it to feed the lean summer months, is almost
absurdly obvious. No wonder that since Mehemet Ali gave so great a
stimulus to the cultivation of cotton and sugar the idea of the
Reservoir has been constantly in the minds of the rulers of Egypt.
The strange thing is that so many hundreds, even thousands, of
years should have elapsed without any attempt of the kind being
made. Perhaps it was due partly to the reverence felt for the
mighty and inscrutable power of the great river, partly to the
passive fatalism innate in the Oriental mind. A few years ago Sir
Benjamin Baker asked a prominent and representative land-owner in
Egypt, a Pasha, and a descendant of the Prophet, what he thought of
the prospects of a Nile Reservoir. With a shrug of his shoulders,
he replied that ‘if it had been possible it would have been done
4,000 years ago.’</p>

<p>He reasoned wiser than he knew. At the second cataract above
Wadi Halfa there are marks upon the rocks and other indications
which go to show that a Dam once existed at that point, used to
regulate the flow of the Nile. Swept away by some unrecorded
disaster, no other direct knowledge of it remains. But it is far
from unlikely that Herodotus, in his account of Lake Mœris in the
Fayoum, has mixed up some tradition of this ancient work in Nubia.
At any rate, whatever be the truth about Lake Mœris, his account
proves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span> beyond all
question that the idea of a Reservoir was familiar to the ancient
Egyptians.</p>

<p>The tradition of a Reservoir somewhere on the upper waters of
the Nile lingered long in Egypt. There is a curious reference to it
in a book of travel by F. Vansleb, a Dutchman who visited Egypt
about the year 1670. The fertility of the Nile flood is caused, he
says, by a fall of dew, which usually takes place on June 17, just
after the appearance of the ‘green’ water. This dew purifies the
foul water, and makes it swell by fermentation. ‘Some of the
country,’ however, he proceeds, ‘that are ignorant of the true
causes of this increase, imagine that it proceeds from a large pond
in Ethiopia <em>in the river itself</em>, which the Abyssins begin
to open about June 12, and let the water out by degrees, more and
more till September 14, by which time they begin to shut it again.
But this is a foolish fancy of the Copties.’</p>

<p>We have seen how the tradition of Lake Mœris fascinated Mehemet
Ali; but the methods of Haroun-al-Raschid were not suited to solid
engineering works, as the history of the Barrage too plainly shows.
None of his descendants, with the exception of the Khedive Ismail,
had the wit to conceive or the ability to execute such an
undertaking, and Ismail’s fantastic imagination was fully occupied
in other directions. Fortunately for Egypt, the project had to wait
until the success of the Barrage made the time ripe for its
execution, and until skilful brains and strong hands were ready to
plan and carry it out in the most efficient manner possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>There were three
problems to be faced: first, Where could such a Reservoir be
erected? second, What arrangements could be devised to avoid the
danger of large silt deposits, which would soon seriously diminish
the capacity of the Reservoir, and, if allowed to accumulate,
render it in no long time entirely useless? third, Supposing that
the difficulties of site and design could be overcome, where was
the money to be found? During the first years of the British
occupation, while Egypt was still painfully struggling upwards from
the abyss of bankruptcy into which she had been cast by the mad
whirlwind of extravagance in Ismail’s reign, it was no time for the
inception of original works on a grand scale. But in 1890 the
matter became an affair of practical politics, and was at last
seriously taken in hand. Meantime discussion had been raging as to
the best locality for the Reservoir. An American gentleman, Mr.
Cope Whitehouse, took up the case of the Wadi Rayan, a depression
in the desert to the south-west of the Fayoum. This, he maintained,
was the real site of the ancient Lake Mœris, and here the Reservoir
ought to be. He had no professional knowledge, and he was utterly
wrong in his ideas; but his vehement method of controversy kept the
subject thoroughly alive. The whole land was filled with his
clamour, and every expert was forced to give his own views in
self-defence. The debate served a useful purpose. Gradually it came
to be recognised that the river-bed itself was the proper place for
storing the water by means of a Dam. Authorities differ as to whom
belongs the credit of first making this suggestion, or, rather, of
first reviving the tradition<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_73">[73]</span> of the past; but it seems pretty clear that
Sir Samuel Baker suggested the construction of a Dam at the first
cataract at Assouan as far back as 1867.</p>

<p>However that may be, in 1890 the Government took the matter up,
and charged Mr. W. Willcocks with the task of examining the river
north of Wadi Halfa, reporting upon the best available site for the
Dam, and preparing a design for it. After a careful survey, his
plans were completed in 1894, and his design for a Reservoir at
Assouan was then submitted to an International Committee of
Engineers, consisting of Sir Benjamin Baker, M. Boulé, and Signor
Torricelli. Mr. Willcocks’ plans were, with some modifications,
accepted by a majority of the Commission, and to him belongs the
honour of having designed the Dam. The selection of the Assouan
site solved the first of the three difficulties. There is at this
point an extensive outcrop of granite clean across the valley of
the Nile, which it was thought would give sound rock everywhere at
a very convenient level for the foundations of the Dam. Moreover,
the trough of the river above the cataract and a long way south of
it is exceptionally deep, and this makes it possible for a greater
amount of water to be stored up behind the Dam. But the prime
necessity was for a solid foundation. Elsewhere in Egypt the bed of
the Nile is composed of shifting sands, on which it would have been
impossible to build a Dam capable of holding up so great a head of
water.</p>

<p>Mr. Willcocks’ design solved the second difficulty, the problem
of constructing a Dam strong enough<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_74">[74]</span> for the purpose, and yet of avoiding the
danger of filling up the Reservoir by too great accumulations of
silt. The other great Dams in the world, as, for instance, that
built by Sir Arthur Cotton on the Godavery River, in India, are
solid throughout. They are planned so that the rising flood shall
pass freely over the top of them. But the Assouan Dam is of a type
previously unknown, and its success ought to stimulate perennial
irrigation in many parts of the world where such projects have
hitherto proved failures. Its principle is that even the highest
flood shall pass, not over it, but through it. To this end it is
pierced with 180 openings, which are like tunnels in the great mass
of masonry. The openings are controlled by powerful sliding-gates
worked from above. During the months of the flood every gate will
be up, and the ‘red’ water, carrying all its heavy burden of silt,
will pass through without impediment. Later in the year, about the
end of November, when the flood has subsided and very much less
matter is carried in suspension, the sluice-gates begin to be
gradually closed, and by the end of February the Reservoir is full,
without having affected the normal discharge of the river in any
appreciable degree. From April to July the water thus stored up is
let out by degrees for employment, according to the state of the
river and the requirement of the crops. By the time the next flood
begins to come down all the stored water will have passed out, and
every sluice will be once more open to give free passage to the
rising stream. Although the Nile in December and January carries an
insignificant amount of sediment compared to that brought down in
August<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span> and September,
it yet brings down a very considerable quantity, far greater than
most other rivers at any time, and quite enough to go a long way
towards silting up the bed of the Reservoir, if it was allowed to
remain. But for this the river provides its own remedy: every year
the force of the flood will act like a gigantic broom, sweeping the
floor of the Reservoir. The sluices, arranged in sets of five, are
distributed at different levels, according to the formation of the
river-bed on the upstream side, so as to facilitate this process to
the utmost. During the months of the inundation the Nile at Assouan
pours down for weeks together a volume of 10,000 tons of water per
second, and sometimes as much as 14,000 or 15,000 tons per second.
The rush of this stupendous mass is sufficient to assure us that
there will be no silting up of the Reservoir.</p>

<p>Two of the difficulties had been thus overcome, when, from a new
and unexpected quarter, a storm sprang up, which very nearly
brought to a standstill the rising fabric of Egyptian prosperity.
The project of the Reservoir would have raised the level of the
water, and held up the river above the Dam to a head of 100 feet;
this would have involved the temporary submersion every year of the
island of Philæ, with its famous Temple of Isis, Pharaoh’s Bed, and
other monuments. A terrific hubbub arose. Archæological and
antiquarian societies, which until then had sometimes belittled the
monuments of Philæ as belonging to an inferior period, poured in
their protests. People who had never heard of Philæ before, but who
were none the less influential for that, joined in the outcry.
Diplomatists,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> whose
one desire was to embarrass our progress in Egypt, took up the
cause of Art with a will. These champions of humanity at large
forgot the poor fellaheen, to whom the extra water means all the
difference between misery and happiness; nothing would satisfy them
but the complete abandonment of the project. The engineers fought
stoutly in the interests of Egypt; they offered to raise the whole
of the monuments bodily, or to transport them to the neighbouring
island of Bigeh; but, though they saved the Dam, the original
design was lost, and the Dam to-day is 33 feet lower than it ought
to have been. The foundations of Philæ have been underpinned and
strengthened, the island will only be partially submerged, and the
injury to Egypt can only be faintly estimated.</p>

<p>Was the sacrifice worth it? The value of Philæ lies in its
beauty more than in its antiquarian interest. No one who has
witnessed night after night the glorious sunsets on the Nile, the
mysterious charm of the changing waters, the dark belt of palms
reflected in the river below and standing out in strong contrast
against the sky, the limestone cliffs of the desert clear-cut in
the dry air, and flushing pink in the radiance of the indescribable
after-glow, no one who has seen the Temples of Karnak, could
hesitate to make so small a sacrifice, in comparison, for the sake
of the river-side people. Moreover, Egypt is rich in treasures of
the past, as yet undiscovered, and wanting only money for their
development, which the Reservoir would in time supply. And how few
people visit Philæ at all! Surely, even in a country a
thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span> times poorer
than Egypt in artistic and archæological interests, the well-being
of the living and of the unborn should have prevailed.</p>

<p>If all those who joined to swell the uproar had been really
disinterested lovers of the beautiful, there would have been small
reason to complain of their insistence. Enthusiasts can hardly be
expected to listen to the voice of reason, and Philæ has charms to
soften the heart of the most savage utilitarian. Its fate is a
mournful necessity, but it is a necessity, for the question of the
Reservoir had come to be a question of existence for Egypt. Even
the advantage gained by the opposition in lowering the height of
the Dam is only a delay. On the pylon of the Temple of Isis at
Philæ is carved a huge representation of the Pharaoh of the day,
one of the most degenerate of the Ptolemies, catching his defeated
enemies by the hair of their heads with one hand, an uplifted sword
in the other. The whole is a copy of the work of his warlike
ancestors, and even as a copy it is a delusion and a sham; for he
won no victories, defeated no enemies, and, indeed, scarcely
ventured outside the walls of his harem. The apparent victory of
these lovers of Philæ, to call them by their more honourable title,
was not less delusive. Philæ is doomed. Between half drowned and
wholly drowned there is not much difference in the case of an
island, certainly not a difference worth fighting for, and the Dam
will be raised to its full height, perhaps as soon as Egypt is
ready for the extra water.</p>

<p>The financial difficulty remained. In spite of the prosperity of
Egypt, she is, as everyone acquainted<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_78">[78]</span> with her history is aware, bound hand and
foot by international fetters in matters financial. The Caisse de
la Dette, founded to protect Egyptian creditors against the dangers
of bad administration, has remained to be an obstacle to any
improvements that must benefit these interests. The practical
outcome of the system is that, if the Caisse be hostile—and hostile
it has often been—no public work like the Nile Reservoir can be
carried out without the imposition of extra taxation to the amount
of double the annual expenditure required.</p>

<p>Time passed, the need became more pressing, but the prospects of
the Reservoir seemed further off than ever. Besides the regulation
of her water-supply, Egypt had on her hands the question of the
Soudan. From every point of view the reconquest of that province
and the upper waters of the Nile was a prime necessity; no one
could tell how long the war might last, or how great the expense
might be. It seemed impossible that she could bear the cost of two
such enterprises simultaneously, and under such circumstances her
credit would not have been sufficient to raise the capital sum
required on anything like reasonable terms. Not only so, but by the
peculiar constitution of Egyptian finance it was illegal for her to
raise a loan without the consent of the Caisse, a consent which it
was impossible to obtain.</p>

<p>But, fortunately for Egypt, there were a few men with clearer
vision and more faith in the future, and chief among these was Lord
Cromer. The statesman who had controlled the tangled destinies of
Egypt through so many dark years,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_79">[79]</span> and baffled so many tortuous intriguers, as
well as more open foes, was not the man to despair in such a
situation. In 1897 the first negotiations were quietly opened with
Sir E. Cassel. Then came the vote of the majority of the Caisse to
grant £500,000 towards the Soudan Railway, and the successful
action taken in the Courts against that vote. Everyone knows how
this seeming defeat was turned to overwhelming victory by the
decision of the English Government to grant £750,000 for the
railway on certain conditions. The enemies of England in Egypt
received a staggering blow.</p>

<p>But the story was not yet complete. In April, 1898, Sir E.
Cassel arrived at Cairo; in one day the details of the arrangements
to finance the Dam were settled; all that night the lawyers drafted
the necessary documents; a Council of Ministers was hastily called
in the morning, and the contracts were signed. Sir E. Cassel was to
provide the necessary funds for the execution of the work,
£2,000,000; repayment by the Egyptian Government was to be deferred
altogether for five years, and then to be spread over a period of
thirty years. The first payment of about £78,000 is included in the
Budget for 1903.</p>

<p>Looking back now after five years of prosperity, when Egyptian
securities have actually increased in value, while Consols
themselves have so greatly declined, it is easy to see that the
statesman and the financier were justified in their faith. But in
those days it needed a clear vision and a stout heart to calculate
thirty years ahead—nay, even five—in a country so much the sport of
international politics. The Soudan Campaign was not<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span> yet ended; behind the dervishes
there loomed vague possibilities of worse complications. The
Egyptian Government made a good bargain then, though it would
doubtless make a better now. But it was then, and not now, that the
business had to be settled.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span><a id=
"c08"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br>
<span class="less">THE DAM AND THE NEW BARRAGES</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Once</span> the financial
difficulty was settled, no time was lost in setting to work. As
soon as the flood of 1898 began to subside, Messrs. Aird and Co.,
the contractors, were busy with the foundations of the Dam. Five
years was the period allowed by the contract, but a succession of
low Niles gave unusual facilities for the work, and everything was
completed before the flood of 1902, a year before the specified
time.</p>

<p>From its vast proportions, the Dam is infinitely more impressive
to the imagination than any other of the irrigation works in Egypt.
But from an engineering point of view its construction was a plain,
straightforward business compared with the difficulties of building
a Barrage, where the river-bed offered no more solid foundation
than shifting sands. Still, there was a moment, on the first
uncovering of the river-bed, when its fate seemed to hang in the
balance. The Assouan site had been selected principally because the
outcrop of granite, there running clean across the valley, would
give, it was thought, solid foundation at a convenient level. It
was found that in some places the rock was rotten to a depth of 40
feet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span> It was an
anxious moment, both from an engineering and a financial point of
view. Every foot of rotten rock meant a considerable addition to
the calculated expense, besides modifying the building plan. Once
more Lord Cromer’s strong will saved the situation. On the
financial side he stood on firm ground, and he proved as good an
engineer as he had been a financier. Solid rock was reached, and
the work went steadily forward. Ten thousand men was the usual sum
of those employed, and of these 800 were Italian stone-cutters
specially brought over to deal with the tough granite of which the
Dam is built. Granite and Portland cement are the two great
materials used for welding the fetters of the Nile.</p>

<p>The Dam is about one mile and a quarter in length, and at its
deepest point it is 126 feet high. Sixty-five feet of water can be
held up when the reservoir is full, and it is capable of storing
about 1,200,000,000 cubic metres of water—that is to say, about the
same amount of water as passes through Assouan in a single day when
the flood is at its height. The face of the wall is a slope on the
downstream side, and its width at the bottom corresponds
approximately to its height. Seven hundred and eighty thousand
cubic yards of masonry have been used. On the western side a ladder
of four locks gives passage to boat and steamer traffic at all
seasons.</p>

<p>All parts of Egypt are to benefit in a greater or less degree
from the extra summer supply. The original calculation assumed an
amount to be distributed of 1,065,000,000 cubic metres. It was
allotted as follows:</p>

<p>This division meant that 52,000 acres could be reclaimed to
cultivation in the Fayoum, and 120,000 acres in the Delta. Further,
south of Assiout 200,000 acres could be converted to perennial
irrigation by means of pumps upon the Nile banks. In Middle Egypt
458,000 acres could be converted to perennial irrigation, and in
Gizeh Province 106,000.</p>

<p>A low Nile on the average comes about once in five years, but
assuming that it happened every year, these results may be
expressed in terms of money on the basis that conversion to
perennial irrigation increases the yield per acre by £2 annually,
and that reclaimed land produces a yield valued at £5 annually.
This gives an increase of value in the annual yield:</p>

<p class="nind">while the direct annual gain to the State Exchequer
in rental and taxation would amount to £E378,400.</p>

<p>This does not exhaust the full extent of the benefits of the
Reservoir on which a money value can be placed. For some time Egypt
had been living beyond her real resources in the matter of water.
Encouraged by a series of good years, the acreage<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> of cotton had been greatly
extended. The cotton-plant is very hardy, and can retain its
vitality for a certain period on a very scanty and irregular supply
of water. Cultivators, especially in the Delta, had taken advantage
of this quality up to the very hilt, and the annual crop had
reached an amount of 6,000,000 kantars.</p>

<p>Taking the not very high price of 175 piastres per kantar (1
kantar = nearly 100 pounds), the annual value reached £10,000,000.
A season like that of 1889, when the summer supply was very low,
and not the lowest on record, would mean the loss of at least
one-tenth of this amount, and even more, in spite of the most
successful working of the Barrage, and the most careful system of
rotations. Against such a loss the Reservoir is a complete
insurance, and, as a low year cannot safely be reckoned as
occurring less than once in five years, the annual value of such
insurance must be set down as £200,000. The figures give some idea
of the value of the new supply. The estimate does not err on the
side of exaggeration. It was framed in the most cautious and
conservative manner possible, and, in fact, it would be by no means
rash to put the total annual value a good deal higher.</p>

<p>According to the financial arrangement, the first payment
towards defraying the cost of the works was included in the budget
for 1903, but no fresh taxation for the purpose was to be imposed
till 1904, and even then the full amount of direct benefit to the
Exchequer will not be realized till 1910. Time is thus given for
the full effects of the change to be felt, and the Reservoir will
be paid for out of its own profits. The alteration of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> basin lands to
the new system must take some time, and their cultivators will thus
be given full opportunity to familiarize themselves with the new
methods of agriculture which they will have to employ.</p>

<p>The scheme of distribution allotted nearly 50 per cent. of the
Reservoir supply to the Fayoum and the province between Assiout and
Cairo. Just south of Assiout is the head of the great Ibrahimiyah
Canal, which not only supplies these provinces, but also feeds the
Bahr Yusuf, which waters the Fayoum. It was necessary, in view of
the increased discharge, to widen the upper reaches of this canal,
and to provide it with a new regulating head. But more than this
was required to insure its receiving the proper proportion of water
whenever the sluice-gates of the Dam were opened. Accordingly, at
the same time that the foundations of the Dam at Assouan were laid,
a new Barrage was begun at Assiout just downstream of the head of
the Ibrahimiyah Canal.</p>

<p>In principle the Assiout Barrage is exactly the same as that at
the point of the Delta, and the difficulties of construction were
also exactly similar, for in both cases the foundations had to be
laid on the same shifting sands, and as each section of the work
was undertaken a portion of the river had to be diverted from its
course by means of temporary earthen dams. The shifting nature of
the river-bed, the almost personal malignity of the water,
constantly bursting through in countless springs, each of which had
to be separately dealt with and suppressed, called forth the
highest exercise of engineering skill. But the experience gained
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span> the long struggle
with the imperfections of the earlier Barrage infallibly told its
tale. Every difficulty was successfully encountered, and the
Assiout Barrage was completed by the summer of 1902, and was able
to hold up the 10 feet of water required of it, without any
failure, at the first attempt.</p>

<p>The visible part of this Barrage, which is just over half a mile
in length, consists of a viaduct or bridge with 111 archways, each
16 feet 5 inches in width, closed by strong iron gates, working in
grooves made in the supporting piers, and raised or lowered from
above. In contrast to the Delta Barrage, it is built throughout of
stone, and not of brick. At the western end is a lock, the largest
in Egypt, through which the largest of the boats that ply upon the
Nile can easily pass. Below the water lies the strength of the
structure. The viaduct rests upon a solid platform of granite and
cement, 10 feet deep and 87 feet wide, set at a suitable depth
below the bed of the river. As a further precaution against the
action of the water, there are also below the platform two
continuous lines of iron sheet-piles, with hermetically sealed
joints. With such a series of obstacles to encounter, the danger of
the water forcing its way through underneath the Barrage is small
indeed. The whole amount of masonry used in this Barrage is 220,000
cubic yards.</p>

<p>The prosecution of these great works in Upper Egypt by no means
exhausted the activity of the Irrigation Department; indeed, it
would almost seem that the building of Barrages has become part of
its ordinary routine, for a third remains to be<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span> chronicled. This is the Zifta
Barrage on the Damietta branch of the Nile, halfway between the
point of the Delta and the sea. Because it lies in a district
unvisited by tourists, though very important commercially, its
construction has not been heralded by any blowing of trumpets. Yet
it is a work of the very first class, and deserves to be reckoned
among the greatest of the triumphs of the department. Built on the
same plan as the Assiout Barrage, and, like it, capable of holding
up 10 feet of water, it is designed to secure a better distribution
of the supply north of the Delta Barrage. As the area of the
cultivated land extended gradually northward, it became apparent
that the canal system taking off from above the original Barrage
was becoming too long to admit of the water in times of pressure
reaching the northernmost parts of the country. There were some who
held that a second Barrage, with a new system of canals taking off
from it, should have been erected on the Damietta branch, even in
preference to the new stone weirs, which have increased the
strength and distributing power of the old one. The dispute has
been happily settled by the adoption of both projects, and with the
Zifta Barrage completed in time for the summer of 1903, and the new
supply from Assouan, the reclamation of the northern lands will go
steadily forward.</p>

<p>It has been already pointed out that it is almost as important
to get the water off the land as to get it on, and the proper
drainage of the Delta lands has been the necessary complement of
all the new schemes. Though eclipsed by the splendour<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> of the Reservoir and other
creations more taking to the eye, the performance of the engineers
in this direction during the last few years has been sufficient to
make them very memorable in irrigation annals. Since 1896 about
1,000 kilometres of new drains have been dug, and nearly as great a
length of existing drains remodelled. It has cost the Egyptian
Government close upon a million of money, but that this expenditure
has not been thrown away is proved by the great rise in the value
of all the lands affected.</p>

<p>The Zifta Barrage cost about £500,000, the Assouan Dam and the
Assiout Barrage £3,200,000. Apart from the ordinary expenditure on
maintenance and the suppression of the corvée, the twenty years
ended 1902 have seen an expenditure of £9,000,000 devoted to
irrigation and drainage. There could be no greater proof of the
wisdom of those who have directed Egyptian policy during that
period. However pressed they have been at different times by
demands for immediate expenditure on other objects when resources
were low, they have always adhered steadily to a policy of
liberality towards public works likely to be of a remunerative
character. In no other country do economic laws work out their
results with greater directness and certainty. Reproductive
expenditure is really worthy of its name, and brings its visible
and tangible fruit almost without a moment’s delay. As they have
sown, so have they reaped. There can be no comparison between this
expenditure and the benefits it has conferred upon Egypt. Three
salient examples may be given to point the force of these
remarks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>First, the works
undertaken by Colonel Ross to improve the system of basin
irrigation in Upper Egypt. 1877 was a year of very low flood, and
nearly 1,000,000 acres were sharaki—that is, entirely exempted from
taxation owing to absence of irrigation. In 1899, a worse year—in
fact, the lowest flood of the century—the sharaki lands were no
more than 250,000 acres, a result mainly due to the successful
reforms carried out by Colonel Ross in 1888-89. 1902 was a year
very similar to 1899, and the sharaki acreage was no more than
140,000 acres.</p>

<p>Second, the case of the Assiout Barrage. The work was finished a
year before the time named in the contract. On August 15, 1902, the
usual date of filling the basins, the flood was exceptionally low,
and it was decided to lower the gates of the Barrage. By so doing
the water-level of the canals was raised by 1½ metres, an increase
which was more than sufficient to avert the threatened disaster.
The money value of the crops thus secured to the land-owners of the
Fayoum and Middle Egypt is estimated at not less than £600,000. The
cost of the new works at Assiout, including the new regulator on
the Ibrahimiyah Canal, was about £875,000. Thus, in the first year
of their existence they nearly repaid their whole cost, and that,
too, as it were, by a sidewind; for the Barrage’s real function is
to hold up the river in the low summer season, and not in the
flood.</p>

<p>Third, the case of the Assouan Reservoir itself. The summer
supply in 1903 has been the lowest on record; the discharge at
Assouan has fallen to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
200 cubic metres per second. By means of the Reservoir this supply
has been actually doubled. Had the flood been late in coming down,
it would have been impossible to distribute the water at so liberal
a rate. The Soudan gauges gave warning that an early flood was to
be expected, and thus the authorities were able to calculate with
certainty, and open the sluice-gates with much greater freedom. But
the calculation would have been a useless exercise unless there had
been a store to draw upon. At the lowest computation the loss
avoided may be reckoned at a couple of millions.</p>

<p>The administrators of Egypt have had many difficulties and
obstacles in their path, but to be able to point to such results is
a great compensation; their efforts need no formal monument.</p>

<span class="less">THE INAUGURATION OF THE RESERVOIR</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">December</span> 10, 1902, was the
official date of the inauguration of the Reservoir, a memorable day
in the history of Egypt, and worthy to be marked with red even in
the unchanging Mohammedan calendar.</p>

<p>The making of the Dam has been a great time for Assouan. The
town has thriven and prospered beyond all knowledge since the
days—not so very long ago—when two British battalions occupied the
barracks on the hill overlooking the river to the south. The
barracks are crumbling to pieces now, and only one or two
blockhouses remain as memorials of the past state of siege and fear
of dervish raids. The tide of war has rolled far away and spent
itself utterly in remote corners. The whole of the Soudan lies
between Assouan and the frontier of any possible enemy. Even the
yellow fort is untenanted save by a few policemen. True, for four
years an army of 10,000 men has been marshalled here, but it was an
invasion of the arts of peace, creative and not destructive.
Possibly the inhabitants would have liked their occupation to go on
for ever; but even the best of times must have an end, and it was a
good occasion for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
holiday. In every Nile village flags and bunting were flying. For
once the fields were deserted, and everywhere the people crowded to
the bank in the hope of catching a glimpse of the Khedive and his
distinguished guests. Here and there the gaffirs, or local
policemen, lined the shore, standing stiffly to attention, or
saluting with their Remingtons in the regulation attitude of
European soldiers, which contrasted quaintly with their loose,
flowing robes and white turbans.</p>

<p>At Assouan the faithful subjects of the Khedive surpassed
themselves. Sunny Assouan lends itself readily to a festal garb.
Situated where the Nile broadens out after emerging from the rocky
defile of the cataract, the town has a most picturesque aspect at
all times; its embanked river-front makes it the neatest of all the
cities of Upper Egypt. Elephantine and the Sirdar’s Island rise
green and smiling out of the broad bosom of the river; the
perpetual blue sky makes everything doubly attractive to the
Northern visitor. Dressed for the festival, it was a charming
scene. Triumphal arches of the sacred yellow and brown, gorgeous
hangings and many-coloured festoons, bore testimony to the Oriental
love of vivid hues; steamers and dahabiehs, moored in line along
the shore as well as along Elephantine Island, vied with each other
in their decorations, and numerous feluccas were plying to and fro,
half hidden by their burdens of flags and palm-leaves. At night
thousands of lamps decorated shore and river alike, and the whole
scene resembled nothing so much as a Henley in Regatta Week, with
its illuminations unrestrained by doubts of weather. To the ear,
however, the voices of the night told<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_93">[93]</span> a very different tale. The crooning song of
the Nubian boatmen, ‘Great is the Prophet, praise be to him!’
accompanying the creaking of their clumsy oars with monotonous
persistency, sounded weird and barbaric over the twinkling waters.
The bustle in the town, too, was no mere ordinary festal murmur;
for this was the month of Ramadan, and the feast of lamps meant a
great deal to all faithful Moslems. All day long they have
abstained from food or drink, and the going down of the sun is
keenly welcomed as the end of one day more of fasting.</p>

<p>The secret of the prosperity of Assouan lies in its granite. It
is the granite bed of the river at this point that makes the
Reservoir possible; here are the granite quarries from which the
Dam was built, and from which every ruler of Egypt who wished to
raise a monument for all time has drawn his supplies. Nothing that
I have seen in this country brings the past so near as these
quarries. Here lies a rough-hewn obelisk, just ready to be rolled
away; here an enormous block of stone half hollowed into a bath for
an Emperor, or a sarcophagus for an Apis bull, designed by some
mighty ruler who ‘thought in continents,’ and recked little of the
lives and labours of thousands provided he gratified his whim. But
suddenly death or some other fate intervened, and a feebler or more
merciful generation has never taken up the work. You may see the
marks of the wedges on some great face of rock, as fresh as if it
was only yesterday that Pharaoh’s workmen had driven them in and
poured water on the wood till it swelled and burst the stone; down
below is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span> the fallen
piece still waiting for the mason who never came back to it.
Perhaps some of the very stones cut by Cheops or Rameses have been
smoothed and planed and set in the Great Dam.</p>

<p>Passing along the raised causeway, down which so many great
monuments have been rolled slowly to the river, I came through a
long stretch of burning desert to a spur on the northern extremity
of the granite hills. Here, unexpectedly, I found myself
overlooking the lake formed by the filling of the Reservoir.
Graceful lines of palm-trees showed where the banks of the river
had once been. Philæ was but an insignificant speck on the blue
waters, overpowered by the fantastic piles of granite boulders that
hem in the valley. In the far distance rose some lofty hills,
crowned by dazzling sand that might easily have been mistaken for
snow. The Dam builders have been accused of vandalism, but they
have created a standing pool in the wilderness of surpassing
beauty. The view of the lake was not the only attraction of the
spot; at my feet lay a colossal statue of Osiris, destined for some
temple, but never moved from the spot where it was hewn.</p>

<p>Ancient Egypt may well look on with scornful wonder at our pride
in our achievements. The Great Pyramid at Gizeh contains three
times as much solid masonry as the Dam, cut from these same
quarries. Every one of those huge blocks had to be dragged to the
river, and carried down 600 miles, before it was hoisted into its
place. As an achievement of mechanical power the Great Dam cannot
compare with the Great Pyramid;<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_95">[95]</span> but when at last I climbed a little hill hard
by the river, below the Reservoir itself, and saw the whole length
of the great stone rampart, stretching right across the valley, the
contrast between the world of Pharaoh and our own came strong upon
me.</p>

<p>Pharaoh, to whom time and life were nothing, out of the misery
of the forced labour of his subjects, raised a perfectly useless
monument of his own folly; yet he achieved his object, and made his
tomb one of the wonders of the world. We, with the free labour of
voluntary workers—paid, fed, and cared for, instead of being driven
by the whip—have dared to harness Nile himself. It is a work vital
to the interests of millions of dwellers by the river. Yet who can
say that the fame of the Pyramid will not endure the longer?
Hundreds of years after the time of Cheops a mighty Dam was built
in Southern Arabia for a like purpose of irrigation; it lasted for
eight centuries or more, and its bursting in 100 <span class=
"sc2">A.D.</span> is mentioned in the Koran. Its ruins remain to
this day, and show that it was larger than the Nile Dam. Eight
hundred years is a long life for a reservoir, but if this one lasts
a quarter of that period it will have repaid its cost many hundred
times over.</p>

<p>Certainly it looks strong enough to last as long as the Nile
itself. Strength, and nothing but strength, shows in every stone of
it. Square, solid, and massive, it runs from shore to shore in an
absolutely straight line, without the slightest attempt at any
trace of ornament or decoration. Clearly, effect has been the last
thing thought of.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
Even the sluice-gates have absolutely plain rectangular openings,
and it detracts from the symmetry of the design that, owing to
engineering exigencies, they are not all of one height, but run in
sections of five, some of them lower than others. The top of the
wall runs in a simple, unbroken level; there is nothing to catch
the eye as it travels up the steep face of masonry except the
slightest change in the angle of the slope to a nearly complete
perpendicular. The wall simply leaves off because its builders
thought it high enough for the present. Along the broad surface of
the summit runs a tramway, with plenty of room for a man to walk on
either side, flanked by perfectly plain, solid parapets as high as
the waist, and more than a yard thick, of a piece with the masonry
below.</p>

<p>On the eastern side the Dam is unostentatiously built into the
living rocks; no arch or pylon marks its start. On the western side
it is flanked by a ladder of four immense locks, set in a
mountainous embankment. The gallows-like arms of the draw-bridge,
hideous in appearance, but a marvel of mechanical ingenuity, over
the upper gate of the highest lock are the only break in the long,
unrelieved level. The hard gray colour of the granite strengthens
the general impression, though in time every part exposed to the
action of the water will be coated with the shining black varnish
which the Nile mud always lays on granite, and it will look exactly
the same as the natural bed of the stream.</p>

<p>How different all this is from the prettiness of the Delta
Barrage, with its brickwork, originally<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_97">[97]</span> designed and built under French influence,
adorned with archways and towers, of which the lovely garden, with
its flowers and shrubs, its green lawns and leafy trees, on the
tongue of land which it crosses, seems a natural and appropriate
part! The Assouan Dam is the work of a practical, unimaginative
race. Its builders have had before them the problem of harnessing
the great river with a yoke that cannot be broken; they had to hold
up a reservoir containing 100,000,000 tons of water, so that for
140 miles the river is turned back upon itself; and they have
succeeded.</p>

<p>In December all but a few of the sluice-gates are shut, for the
reservoir has to be filled. But imagine it at the height of the
flood, when the collected rainfall of half a continent is crashing
past at the rate of nearly 1,000,000 tons a minute, and through
each of the 180 openings shoots a solid cube of dark water to dash
thundering in clouds of white foam on the rocks below, and rush
tumultuously down the swirling slopes of the cataract. Think of the
huge bulk of water held up when the reservoir is full. Then you
will understand something of the difficulties of the work. Solidity
and strength could not but be the first and overpowering idea in
the minds of the builders. The longer you look, the more you are
impressed. The vast dimensions of the Dam grow upon you from moment
to moment. There is, after all, a fierce beauty in those
uncompromising features, grimly set in the determination to hold
the river in bondage. The massive structure is in harmony with the
forces of Nature. Feeble and puny it<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_98">[98]</span> may be compared with even the least of their
handiwork, but it is impossible not to feel that its builders have
been inspired with a spark of the same creative power. They drew
their plans, and dug and built and strove their best to control the
great river. They have succeeded because a portion of that spirit
of Nature against which they struggled has passed into their
work.</p>

<p>Is it too much to hope that a scheme of decoration may yet be
found in consonance with these ideas? Some day the Dam will be
raised to the full height of the original design, thus doubling the
present capacity of the Reservoir. Then will be the time to finish
the work magnificently, and make of it a stately monument, to be
the glory of Egypt as well as the foundation of her material
prosperity. The subject is worthy of a great artist. Only a scheme
conceived on grand lines, perfectly simple and bold, can have the
least chance of success. Anything else would be as ridiculous as a
proposal to place a statue of ordinary dimensions on the top of the
Great Pyramid. The difficulties are great, and so would be the
expense, so great, indeed, that it would be far better to avoid any
attempt at decoration, unless the results are to be admirable
beyond all question. Are there no possible successors to the
architects of Karnak?</p>

<p>The ceremony of inauguration was, like the masonry of the Dam
itself, sensible and solid, but it was not impressive. Those who
arranged its details had forgotten the vastness of the theatre in
which it was performed. From the purely spectacular point of view
it was a failure. Egypt has no money yet to spend on functions.
Perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> a better
stage management might have made a better display without any
greater expense. The material benefits of English rule would be
appreciated none the less gratefully for a little gilding. But the
Englishman in Egypt has had other things to think about than the
organization of what the native would call ‘fantasias.’ So he fell
back on the established custom of his own country. Wherever he goes
he carries with him law and order and equity and righteousness and
commonsense, and he also carries a peculiar kind of public
ceremonial routine. Everybody knows it. The invited guests arrive
in special trains, and perspire in top-hats and frock-coats for an
interminable time, until Royalty arrives full of gracious smiles
amid a cheering crowd. The distinguished persons pass into a pen
carpeted with red baize, where all the notables are assembled.
Somebody makes a perfectly inaudible speech, which receives a
gracious and inaudible reply. A button is pressed here, a lever
turned there, and several extraordinary things begin to happen in
consequence. Then a number of good men and true receive some
well-earned decorations, Royalty graciously departs, and everybody
presses home as best he can, while the band plays the National
Anthem. The whole is accompanied by the clicking of innumerable
cameras, and nobody quite realizes the importance of the occasion
until he reads about it afterwards. At the Nile Reservoir all this
happened in due order with the necessary local variations. The
officials wore red tarbushes instead of top-hats, and every
sensible person carried a cotton umbrella over his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>But apart from
the ceremonial, the scene was deeply interesting. If the day’s
routine was insignificant, it was because the overpowering presence
of the Dam itself dwarfed every other presence. And the names of
those assembled there recalled vividly the thrilling history of
Egypt during the last twenty years. There were statesmen and
diplomatists, soldiers and engineers, men of business and men of
letters, all of whom, in some field or other, had done their part
in building up the fallen country. Some, too, were there who,
submitting contentedly before the logic of accomplished facts,
burying old rivalries and animosities, had come in no unfriendly
spirit to witness the realization of much that it had once been
their policy to hinder. But if all the rest had been absent, the
presence of one man, the Chief, whose wise counsel and guiding hand
had been everywhere, would have been sufficient to represent all
that these twenty years have meant to Egypt. Well might Lord Cromer
and the irrigation engineers review their work with satisfaction.
To them the Reservoir means the successful culmination of a great
policy long and steadily pursued, nothing less than the
establishment of the prosperity of Egypt upon a sure and certain
basis: for that is what the regulation of the Nile involves. In
Egypt, at any rate, they require no formal monument. Their praise
stands clearly writ on the face of every cultivated field
throughout the country.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span><a id=
"c10"></a>CHAPTER X<br>
<span class="less">BRITISH RULE IN EGYPT</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">At</span> the inauguration of the
Nile Reservoir at Assouan, it was an Egyptian Minister of Public
Works who read an Arabic speech congratulating the Khedive on the
completion of the great work which is to make his name famous among
the rulers of Egypt. Among all the flags that decorated the town
and the craft on the river, the most infrequent was that of
England. A casual observer, knowing nothing of the country, might
easily have overlooked the number of Englishmen wearing the
tarbush, that red badge of Egyptian officialdom, and gone away
thinking that even the presence of the brother of the King of
England marked nothing but a compliment paid by one great Power to
another. He might well have been astonished to be told that the
Dam, which will confirm and increase the prosperity of Egypt, is no
less an evidence of the stability of British rule. It is just
possible that immediately after our first occupation we might have
been able to evacuate the country—not, indeed, without danger to
our hold upon the highroad to India, or without detriment to the
true interests of Egypt, but at least without loss of honour to
ourselves. Since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
then, in spite of the efforts of our statesmen at home, it has
become more and more impossible.</p>

<p>Among the guests at Assouan there might have been seen a
quiet-looking old gentleman, with a gray beard and bushy whiskers,
beaming benevolently through gold-rimmed spectacles. His figure was
that of a man, once sturdy and square-set, over whose head had
passed years of ease and good living. At the first glance, in his
frock-coat and tarbush, he looked like any other comfortable
Turkish gentleman. Yet there was no one present with a more
interesting past than he. For this was Mukhtar Pasha, who bears the
proud title of Ghazi, ‘the victorious,’ the hero of the Caucasus in
the Russo-Turkish War. He came to Egypt in 1887 as special Turkish
Commissioner, to arrange for the British evacuation under the
Drummond-Wolff Convention. It is well known how France and Russia
at the last moment intervened to prevent Turkey from ratifying the
agreement. A special Providence guards the British Empire against
the efforts of its rulers. But Mukhtar remains as Turkish
Commissioner in Egypt without duties, and probably without pay, a
reminder of past eccentricities of British policy.</p>

<p>We have travelled far from the days when it was seriously
proposed by Conservative statesmen to make Turkey responsible for
civilization and good government in Egypt. To-day no one in his
senses could wish to put an end to British rule. Let a man start
from Assouan and survey the great series of irrigation works—the
Reservoir, the Assiout Barrage, the Regulator of the Ibrahimiyah
Canal, the Koshesha Regulator, the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_103">[103]</span> Barrages and Weirs at the point of the
Delta and at Zifta; let him examine the intricate system of canals,
siphons, wheels, drains, dykes, and sluices, by which the water is
distributed over the cultivated lands, and let him reflect on what
would happen if all this were left in Egyptian hands. Inevitably,
sooner or later, the whole thing would come to ruin, and the
greater the height of prosperity to which the country has attained
under the system of perennial irrigation, the greater would be its
fall. Egypt has been called the classic land of baksheesh, and it
will not lose its character in a generation or two. Imagine a
Government in need of money; what better thumbscrew could an
Oriental despot wish for than the command of the water-supply? When
a land-owner knew that he could be ruined by the shutting of a
sluice-gate, he would pay anything without a struggle. The golden
goose would be killed in every direction. Even under a
well-intentioned Government it would only be regarded as natural
for a local official to make free use of such unrivalled
opportunities to supplement his pay. Corruption is not a vice in
Oriental eyes; it is the habit of centuries. That is why, with
every extension of scientific irrigation, the need for European
supervision becomes greater, and since we can allow no Power but
ourselves to hold Egypt, European means British.</p>

<p>An amusing instance of the native way of looking at such matters
occurred in connection with the making of the Reservoir. A certain
sum was allotted for the compensation of those who would be flooded
out of house and home. Some of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_104">[104]</span> Assouan people saw their chance. It does
not take much to build a native house. In a short time the
Government inspectors had the pleasure of being shown a number of
brand-new buildings on the foreshore, with the whitewash still wet
upon them. Great was the disappointment of these ingenious
speculators. In another case a man was building a boat; he was
repeatedly warned to move his work, but would not. Only when the
water began actually to rise did he become seriously alarmed, and
sent down a letter of remonstrance. Again the position was
explained to him; but again he advanced his request that the gates
might be opened, accompanied with a hint that he might be willing
to make some small acknowledgment of his obligation. Realizing at
last the futility of his demand, he exclaimed in despair, ‘What is
the use of your Dam if you cannot let the water out to save my
boat?’</p>

<p>The two great principles of British policy in Egypt have been
irrigation and low taxation. Irrigation is the vital necessity to
Egypt. Other departments of Government, however urgent their claims
might be, have had to wait and to be starved until the reproductive
works could be established and set going. Every penny that could be
spared had to be cast upon the waters. At the same time we found
the people overburdened with taxation on account of the Public
Debt, and also bound hand and foot in the meshes of the usurer. We
could not, however powerful we might be, hope to hold securely a
country with 11,000,000 of population, unless we have something
else than mere force to look to. To the Egyptians we are aliens by
race and religion, we have no ties of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_105">[105]</span> custom or intermarriage; we have nothing
but their material interests to appeal to. If we can make them
prosperous, if they can save money without fear of confiscation, if
we can secure to them the fruits of their labour, we have done a
great deal to strengthen the basis of our rule.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the fellaheen do appreciate the benefits
of British rule; it would be strange if they did not. The corvée is
gone. Not only has taxation been enormously reduced in amount, but
its method of collection has been made equitable and regular.
Whereas in former days the tax-collector was in league with the
money-lender, and contrived to demand his payments at times when it
was certain that the cultivator of the soil would have no money,
and would have to pledge his growing crops to raise the amount, now
the time of payment is adjusted to suit the harvests. Moreover, the
new Agricultural Bank lends to the fellaheen at a rate far below
that demanded by the Syrian, Greek, or Coptic usurers; the State
gives a small guarantee, and the Government tax-collectors collect
the interest and instalments of the loans at the same time as the
taxes. The Egyptians are naturally a thrifty people; they are
taking advantage of this plan, and are very punctual in their
repayments. When the scheme was first started, it was met with
grave disapproval by the professed economists. The fellaheen, they
said, will borrow first from the Bank, and will then execute a
second mortgage, and borrow more on the same exorbitant terms from
their old blood-suckers. But Lord Cromer’s keen insight into the
character of the people has once again been justified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>It is true that
a generation is growing up that knew not Ismail. These have lived
only in the new order of things, and have no personal reminiscences
to sharpen their enjoyment of the present; but even so the number
of those actually discontented must be few, and the number of those
who would carry their discontent into action still fewer. More than
this, perhaps, it would be foolish to expect. In the East a
reforming nation could not be really popular, except among
fighters. And the Egyptians are no fighters—they are peaceable
people, who love their homes; no one joins the army except by the
necessity of conscription. Even the reformatory school-boy cannot
be induced to volunteer for so much as the band. Honour and glory
are nothing to them; they seek no bubble reputation at the cannon’s
mouth. Again, the Englishman endeavours to establish impartial
justice in the Courts. That is all very well if your opponent is a
richer man than you; but what if you could have outbid him quite
easily? It is a good thing to be free from the fear of being
bastinadoed and fined because your neighbour has given false
evidence against you, or because he has influence with the police.
But if you, which is at least as likely, wish to do the same to
him, how do you profit by the reform?</p>

<p>Then, too, the alien rule may be just and righteous and full of
solid benefit, but it is dull. In old days a man might be
maltreated and flogged, he might have his property confiscated, he
might even lose his life, according to the whim of his ruler, but
the same whim might equally make him Grand Vizier. Such
fluctuations appeal to the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_107">[107]</span> Oriental imagination. A veiled Protectorate
must always be something of a mystery to an Egyptian; the personal
rule of a despot, Effendina, the Lord of all, is much more suited
to his instincts. At any rate, it is difficult to discover much
outward manifestation of an appreciation of British rule; but it
would be wrong to argue too strongly from that. The fact is rather,
indeed, a proof of the lightness of the governing hand. The
Egyptians know very well that we shall never resent any opposition;
they have confidence in our forbearance. But if time should bring a
change once more—and there have been many changes in the past—it
would be an evil day for those who had been too open in their
support of English rule. It is well to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>If you take an intelligent and prosperous Egyptian, old enough
to remember the days of Ismail—for example, a lawyer who has saved
enough money to make a considerable investment in land, the prime
ambition of every native, a man who speaks a couple of European
languages, has had a good education himself, and is very likely
sending his son to Oxford or Cambridge—and question him upon
British rule in Egypt, he will probably tell you something as
follows:—</p>

<p>‘No one who has eyes to see can question the benefit of the
British occupation. The country has attained such prosperity as
never before. We knew very well that no other European nation would
have ruled us with such a single eye to the well-being of the
natives. We realize the devotion and ability of the British
officials. We would rather have you than any other rulers, and we
are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span> well aware that
if you went we might easily become subject to a King Stork. In such
a case your popularity would become enormous. Doubtless we should
clamour for your return. But we cannot help dreaming of the glories
that might have been ours if our Khedives had not wasted their
chances. Who can say how great an African empire might have
existed? Long before European nations began to take a hand in the
partition of Africa, we held the whole valley of the Nile to
Uganda. With a wise Government and such a starting-point, what
limits could have been set to our dominions? By the folly of our
rulers we squandered it all, and came to ruin. You have drawn us
out of the pit, but you thrust your benefits upon us at the point
of the bayonet. In spite of them, and perhaps unreasonably, we sigh
for rulers of our own faith and race, and we would sacrifice
something of our prosperity if we could feel ourselves the authors
of what remained.’</p>

<p>Such longings are natural and creditable, and if the men who
feel them were capable or numerous enough to form a real governing
class, the prospects of the future might be different from what
they are. But they are not; and these dreams must remain dreams—for
some time to come, at any rate. Such discontents are the inevitable
outcome of the progress of our educative work in Egypt. Nothing
illustrates it better than the recent movement among the Egyptian
officers of some of the Soudanese battalions. These men had been
trained on a British model; they had gained much experience in the
stern school of actual warfare, and yet they found the higher ranks
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span> the Service
barred to them, and filled by a succession of British officers,
younger and less experienced than themselves. Their discontent was
natural, but their disappointment was also inevitable. In spite of
their training and experience, to have given them the promotion
they wished for would have been to ruin the efficiency of the army.
You cannot make bricks without straw, however scientific your
methods.</p>

<p>It would be very easy to exaggerate the importance of such
murmurings. They are as nothing in the face of the rising tide of
prosperity which has come to the mass of the labouring population
as the result of our rule, and which is its overwhelming
justification. In the Delta provinces, in Middle and Upper Egypt,
in the Fayoum, the undeniable facts rise up and confront you. Wages
have increased in some places as much as 50 per cent., and with the
rise has gone an enormous improvement in all the conditions of
life. The fellaheen are building better houses, they are better
fed, disease is less, they are happier every way. And as labourers
they well deserve it. Many faults they have, but nowhere in the
world can a more industrious, patient, and hard-working people be
found.</p>

<p>In the Mosque el Azhar, the Mohammedan University of Cairo, the
interpretation of the Koran is the principal subject of study, and
it is said that weeks and months, and even years, are spent by
professors and pupils in subtle and ingenious dissertations on such
a question as, Who is your neighbour? Is a man living over your
head more worthy of the name than one who lives next<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span> door? And so on. If in these
reforming days these pundits turn their attention to politics, they
will find an almost equally insoluble problem in attempting to
define the exact nature of British rule in Egypt. To them the
question may safely be left. But while the learned few are
labouring through its intricate maze with the most agreeable lack
of success, the unlearned many will have their own simple answer.
They only know the thing was done; it matters nothing by what
authority. The water came to them regularly in due season, and the
wilderness was made to blossom like the rose.</p>

"c11"></a>CHAPTER XI<br>
<span class="less">SCHEMES FOR THE FUTURE</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> completion of one
programme by the construction of the Reservoir and the works
dependent upon it does not mean stagnation. Irrigation is an
ever-growing and ever-living science. There can be no standing
still. Even in the ordinary routine there are thousands of details
always pressing forward for fresh consideration. It takes but a few
years for a daring innovation to become old-fashioned. The system
of perennial irrigation in Egypt is so young that there is still
much to be learnt. It means a totally new style of agriculture.
Nothing but constant experiment and constant watchfulness will
enable the engineers to distribute the water to the best advantage.
The best methods of reclaiming new land, and of preventing the
deterioration of the old, the maintenance and improvement of
existing locks, weirs, regulators, barrages, and other masonry, the
care of canals and drains—these and an infinity of other matters
fill the life of the irrigation engineer, so that, always
interesting, it is also at times even exciting. Decisions of great
and immediate importance have to be constantly and promptly taken.
Their duty touches very nearly the lives of all who<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span> dwell and labour within their
districts. There can be no question of any folding of the hands to
slumber. But beyond all this, it is the peculiar good fortune of
those whose care is the water-supply of Egypt that they have to
travel in thought or in fact over half a great continent, and
discuss schemes of a magnitude and extent enough to stagger the
imagination of the boldest dreamer. The Anglo-Egyptian army at
Omdurman opened an entirely new chapter in the history of the
control of the Nile.</p>

<p>No one can hold Egypt securely unless he holds also the whole
valley of the Nile. The sources of the river in hostile, or even in
indifferent, lands must always be a grave cause of danger, or, at
the best, anxiety. If tradition be correct, the Abyssinians on more
than one occasion made use of their position on the Nile as a
powerful lever in negotiations with Egypt. Vansleb, the Dutch
seventeenth-century traveller already quoted,<a id=
"FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> is
not perhaps perfectly trustworthy as to his facts, but at least he
is evidence as to the tradition. He had in his possession, he says,
a copy in Arabic of a letter written by David, King of Ethiopia
(<i>i.e.</i>, Abyssinia), surnamed Constantine, to ‘Abu Seid
Barcuk, King of Egypt, in the year of martyrs 1193, in which he
threatens in two distinct places to turn aside the river Nilus and
hinder it from entering into Egypt,’ so as to cause all the
inhabitants to perish with hunger, if he ‘continues to vex the
Copties.’ Vansleb also says that ‘the King of Ethiopia hindered the
current of Nilus and turned it out of Egypt in the days of
Mostanser, one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
the califfes of Egypt, which obliged him to send the Patriarch of
the Copties with rich presents to the King of Ethiopia, to entreat
him to take away the bank, which he had raised to turn aside the
river. The King of Ethiopia having granted this request for the
sake of the Patriarch, the river increased in one night 3 cubits,
which was sufficient to water the fields.’ Doubtless the tradition
is founded on fact; if the country in question had been occupied by
a Power with any engineering skill, there is little doubt that this
method of pressure would have been oftener adopted.</p>

<p>The danger is by no means an imaginary one, and this is
recognised in the latest treaty between the Government of the
Soudan and Abyssinia, concluded May 15, 1902, in which it is laid
down that no work shall be constructed across the Blue Nile, Lake
Tsana, or the river Sobat, which shall arrest the flow of their
waters into the Nile, except by mutual agreement.</p>

<p>If even now it is thought necessary to make formal treaty
arrangements on the subject with Abyssinia, much more real would be
the apprehension if the Soudan Government were hostile to Egypt.
But quite apart from any hostility, an important question might
arise. We have seen what great efforts have been made in Egypt
under the system of perennial irrigation to secure a good supply of
water in the summer months; it is then that the river is at its
lowest; the best of reservoirs can only supplement the natural flow
of the river. At the very time that it would be easiest to do it,
an interference with that natural flow would be most disastrous.
The mere employment of a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_114">[114]</span> considerable amount of water on irrigation
in the Soudan during the summer months might have a very serious
effect. The possession of the Soudan practically guarantees to
Egypt the safety of her water-supply. The fact that the sources of
the White Nile are in purely British territory, and that in the
Soudan itself the British flag flies side by side with the
Egyptian, gives thus a more and more permanent aspect to the
British position in Egypt.</p>

<p>It is calculated that at the present moment another
3,500,000,000 cubic metres of water over and above the present
summer supply, including the Assouan Reservoir, would amply suffice
for all possible requirements in Egypt. When the Dam is raised to
its full height, about 1,000,000,000 cubic metres more will be
provided. If only Egypt were to be considered, the remainder of the
water required could be stored in a similar reservoir built
somewhere above Wadi Halfa. Egypt could then be developed to its
very fullest extent, but ‘such a work,’ as Sir W. Garstin remarks,
‘would leave untouched the countries bordering the river to the
south. Their interests must be safeguarded by such a scheme as will
insure them a proportional share in the prospective benefits.’</p>

<p>From every point of view the interests of the Soudan are vital
to Egypt. Bitterly has she suffered from the neglect of those
interests in the past. Misrule and oppression caused the Mahdi’s
rebellion, with all its burden of shame and suffering. With a more
intelligent enemy the loss of the control of the Nile might have
meant irretrievable disaster. She knows now that a prosperous
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span> contented
Soudan is the best safeguard against rebellion. Upon England, too,
rests the responsibility for the welfare of those vast provinces,
once so shamefully abandoned to barbarism and ruin. English arms
have retrieved that disgrace. It would be impossible to allow the
Soudan to get nothing and Egypt everything, even if such a course
were not certain to be fatal to both.</p>

<p>At present far-reaching schemes are being carefully inquired
into, under the guidance of Sir W. Garstin. Fortunately for Egypt,
she possesses in him an adviser of unsurpassed experience, cool,
careful, and level-headed, upon whose final judgment she may
confidently rely. He has already made a report, after personal
observation, upon the White Nile and its main affluents, and he has
recently returned from a journey to Lake Victoria Nyanza and Lakes
Albert and Albert Edward, the results of which have not yet been
published. Another expedition was also sent in 1902-1903 to explore
Lake Tsana and the upper course of the Blue Nile. A mass of
information is being collected and quietly digested, and in due
time the policy to be pursued will be settled on. For the moment
there is no occasion for hurrying. It will take time for Egypt to
make full use of the advantages of the Assouan Reservoir. The
Soudan, though rapidly progressing, is hardly yet in a position to
reap the advantage of such changes on a great scale. When the
engineers have completed their observations, there will still be
the financial aspect of the question to take in hand. Schemes
involving the regulation of 2,000 miles of river cannot be
subjected to too great scrutiny before arriving at a<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> decision. It would be rash to
speculate on what course will be finally adopted, before all the
data are known, but it will not be out of place to give some
indication of the rival projects in view, and to glance at some of
the arguments for and against.</p>

<p>All the schemes aim at establishing a control over the
head-waters of the Blue or the White Nile, and so increasing the
supply in the river when it is most scanty. Anyone can see that the
Blue Nile depends upon Lake Tsana, which is across the Abyssinian
frontier, and the White Nile upon the Lakes Victoria and Albert
Nyanza. Proposals have been made for regulating the outflow from
each of these lakes, or from them all, and also for preventing the
waste of water which now takes place in the swamp country south of
Fashoda. Up till now the plan of building a dam at the point where
the Blue Nile emerges from Lake Tsana has been most in favour.</p>

<p>It has several great advantages. This lonely lake is situated
some 6,000 feet above sea-level, in a wild and desolate country in
Northern Abyssinia. It is 3,300 square kilometers in extent, and
very deep. During six months in the year there are very heavy rains
in the area which drains into the lake. Between Lake Tsana and
Khartoum, a distance of 1,350 kilometres, the Blue Nile falls over
1,000 metres, and its rocky bed makes it very suitable as a channel
for carrying the water. It is deep and narrow, with high, steep
banks, and so the less liable to evaporation. For every metre by
which the level of the lake was raised, 3,300,000,000 cubic metres
would be stored, and it is obvious that, if the level were
raised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span> 4 or 5
metres, there would, after making a proper deduction for
evaporation, be ample water to supply the greatest demand in Egypt,
and also plenty besides available in the Soudan. There are also
strong arguments for irrigation works on the Blue Nile. After the
Cataracts of Rosaires, which are roughly speaking about halfway
between Khartoum and Lake Tsana, the river passes through fertile
plains consisting of rich alluvial soil, extending to a great
distance on both sides. At present these lands yield only small
returns, dependent as they are upon a somewhat capricious rainfall.
With proper irrigation they would be most productive, and the water
coming down from Tsana might be utilized, without any great
difficulties, by a system of canals starting from this point,
assisted by barrages and weirs. Further, the river would thus be
rendered navigable at all seasons of the year, and would thus
become an effective trade route in the most promising part of the
Soudan. The great objection is that Lake Tsana lies wholly within
Abyssinian territory. Nothing could be done without some very
definite arrangement with the Emperor Menelik, and one that would
be irrevocable by any successor of his who might be less friendlily
disposed. Nothing, in fact, would be absolutely satisfactory unless
complete sovereignty over the Reservoir district were assured to
the Soudan Government. In view of the fact that the whole of this
region is perfectly valueless to Abyssinia, or, indeed, to anybody
else, except for purposes of water-storage, it does not seem
impossible that by some cession of territory, or other compensation
elsewhere, a satisfactory arrangement<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_118">[118]</span> may be come to. But even so, the remoteness
of the lake and the difficulties of transport would prevent the
immediate realization of the scheme. Without a railway from some
point in the Nile Valley it would be practicably impossible to
collect the necessary materials and supplies, and such a railway
will not be an affair of this year or next.</p>

<p>Precisely on the points where the Lake Tsana scheme is weakest
the schemes for utilizing one or both of the great lakes of Uganda
are strongest. Precisely where it is strong they are weakest. Any
works damming the exits of Lake Victoria Nyanza or Lake Albert
would be wholly within British territory. They would also be in a
region much more easily accessible from the sea. Lake Victoria has
already railway communication with Mombasa, and the transport of
material, and also of coolie labour from India would be
comparatively easy. In the case of Lake Albert, a railway would
have to be built from Lake Victoria; but this would be of service
to the country apart from any irrigation works, and would, indeed,
practically establish through communication by boat and railway
between Mombasa and Alexandria. But here their advantages over Lake
Tsana end. The whole region is very much subject to earthquakes.
The strain to which great masonry works would be subjected might be
very severe. The country through which the White Nile passes is
very unsuited to large irrigation works. Much of it is swamp, and
the low slope of the land is ill-adapted for canals. The soil, too,
is poor and light compared with the rich alluvial tracts on the
Blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span> Nile, which
would of course receive no benefit. Practically only the provinces
north of Khartoum would receive any benefit from the increased
supply, and in them the cultivable land can never be more than a
mere strip along the river, so circumscribed are they by the desert
ridges. In any case they would be equally benefited by water coming
from the Blue Nile. Besides this, the negro population living on
the White Nile is very much less advanced, and less likely to form
an industrious agricultural population than the inhabitants of the
Eastern Soudan.</p>

<p>Nor is the bed of the White Nile well adapted for carrying the
water. From Lake Albert to Khartoum the distance is 2,100
kilometres, and the total drop is only 300 metres. It flows slower
through a hotter country. Except between Duffile and Rejaf it is
very wide and shallow, without any banks to speak of, and with a
sandy or muddy bottom. For at least half its course it runs through
swamps, and between Bor and Lake No alone it is calculated to lose
half its volume by dissipation and evaporation in the marshes. But
for the important contribution made by the Sobat, the volume
reaching Khartoum would be very much smaller than it is. If, then,
a considerable extra supply of water is to be brought down from the
equatorial lakes, the scheme must involve a permanent improvement
in the channel of the Bahr el Gebel, as the upper portion of the
White Nile is called.</p>

<p>This, according to Sir W. Garstin, can only be effected in one
way, by embanking the river for its whole length between Bor and
Lake No, a distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
of 624 kilometres. When it is considered that all supplies would
have to be brought from Khartoum, 1,000 kilometres distant; that
during four months of the year work is impossible, owing to the
incessant rains; that the local tribes can never be relied upon for
labour; that the climate is exceedingly bad and unhealthy at all
seasons; and that the actual engineering difficulties in making the
banks would be by no means small, some idea may be formed of the
cost of such an undertaking. It is estimated that to complete it in
five years’ time would involve an expenditure of £3,700,000.
Another proposal, which is really independent of the Reservoir
question, is to use the Bahr el Zeraf to carry the extra summer
supply at present wasted in the marshes. The Bahr el Zeraf is a
branch of the Nile, taking off near Shambe, and entering the river
again below Lake No before the junction of the Sobat. The cost of
preparing the Bahr el Zeraf channel by means of dredging and
embanking is estimated at £1,250,000, and in addition certain
supplementary works would be required.</p>

<p>Until the result of Sir W. Garstin’s observations on the Albert
Lake are known, it will be impossible to make any accurate
comparison of the qualifications of the two lakes Victoria and
Albert for being utilized as reservoirs. Lake Victoria, which lies
between the two ‘Rift Valleys,’ is encircled by a low and shelving
shore. It covers approximately about 70,000 square kilometres. The
Somerset Nile flows out of it, and finds its way into Lake Albert.
Lake Albert is the northernmost of the chain of lakes in the
western Rift Valley, and into<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_121">[121]</span> it drains the Albert Edward Lake by means
of the Semliki River, partly fed by the glaciers of Mount
Ruwenzori. The Nile issues from it at the northern end, not so very
far from where the Somerset Nile enters. Lake Albert is surrounded
by mountains and cliffs. There is comparatively little flat shore
round it. Its area is roughly about 5,000 square kilometres. For
every metre that the surface of each lake was raised, Lake Victoria
would store 70,000,000,000 cubic metres, and Lake Albert
5,000,000,000. These enormous figures are enough to show that, even
when the largest allowance has been made for loss by evaporation,
dams of no great height on either lake would suffice to store quite
sufficient water for all possible needs in Egypt, and all of the
Soudan that could be touched by water coming down the White
Nile.</p>

<p>A very small rise in the level of Lake Victoria would give a
very large reserve of water, and therefore the works regulating its
outflow would be of less dimensions, and so, presumably, less
subject to damage by earthquakes. Being nearer the sea, they would,
moreover, be easier of construction. But Sir W. Garstin so far
totally rejects the idea of Lake Victoria. He says:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>‘The amount of water which could be stored even by a very small
rise in the levels would be far beyond any possible requirements.
This lake may consequently be omitted altogether from any projects
for water-storage. Much of the country adjoining Lake Victoria
Nyanza is densely populated, and the villages are situated close to
the shores. Any considerable rise in the water-levels would flood a
large and populous area of country. It<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_122">[122]</span> must not, moreover, be forgotten that about
half the area covered by this lake falls within German territory.
As the inhabitants of the southern half of this lake would derive
no benefit from such a reservoir, it is quite conceivable that they
might view any such proposal with disfavour.’</p>
</div>

<p>He proceeds to argue that Lake Albert, on the other hand, is
specially adapted by its conformation for the purpose.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>‘With a regulating dam at a point on the river below its exit,
the Albert Lake could well be used to store up water during the
rainy season, which would be discharged into the river during the
months of low supply. In this way a double purpose would be served:
the volume of the river in flood would be diminished, and in summer
would be largely increased. The lake has an enormous catchment
area, and it seems probable that its levels could be, without
serious difficulty, raised to the required height.’</p>
</div>

<p>In all probability the arguments will be found to be conclusive
in favour of a dam at the exit to Lake Albert, but the reasoning
against a regulator for Lake Victoria does not appear at first
sight very cogent. Sir W. Garstin tells us that three years ago the
mean water level of the lake averaged some 8 feet lower than it did
twenty years earlier. But between January 1 and June 1, 1901, the
level rose 3 feet 3 inches. When such fluctuations already occur in
the ordinary course of Nature, it would seem that some very useful
regulation might be carried out without causing the least
inconvenience to any dwellers on the shore, German or otherwise.
All these remarks, however, were written quite tentatively by Sir
W. Garstin before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
he had personally examined these regions, and his next report will
be certain to give fuller information on the matter. Perhaps in the
end both lakes will be subjected to the yoke of the engineers.</p>

<p>Such in brief outline are the gigantic schemes which are now
engaging the attention of the irrigation authorities of Egypt.
Great as are the achievements of the past, they look almost petty
before these visions of the future.</p>

<span class="less">THE SUDD</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">If</span> the White Nile carried
its waters in a channel in any way resembling that of the Blue
Nile, there would be small cause for anxiety over the summer supply
of Egypt. As far as Lado, indeed, the Bahr el Gebel, or Mountain
River, as it is called, does flow with as good a slope and as sound
a rocky bed as any Egyptian could desire. Then it enters upon the
great plain which extends practically as far as Khartoum, but until
Bor is reached it has not to encounter more than the ordinary
troubles of a flat country. The swamps are still well above the
summer level of the river, and the loss of volume is not great. At
Bor, however, the real difficulties begin, and the ‘shorn and
parcelled river strains’ miserably along for some 350 miles through
the real sudd country. The river that leaves Lado in April or March
with a volume of 600 cubic metres per second is reduced to less
than half this amount by the time it emerges from the maze on the
further side, and that, too, although it has nominally received at
Lake No through the Bahr el Ghazal the drainage of a vast
province.</p>

<p>Lake No is the remains of an inland sea which<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span> once covered all this desolate
region. Gradually this lake became silted up with peaty deposits,
and formed a series of swamps and lagoons through which the Bahr el
Gebel from the south and the Bahr el Ghazal from the west wander in
a series of loops and curves without any certain banks. The
smallest rise in the level of the river floods an immense tract of
country, and at all times of the year the sudd region is one
gigantic evaporating pan. The Bahr el Ghazal, so far as any active
contribution to the volume of the Nile is concerned, is practically
lost altogether, though by spreading out over the marshes it fills
a space which the Bahr el Gebel would otherwise occupy, and so
helps to form a sort of reservoir, which prevents any rapid fall in
the level of the White Nile.</p>

<p>All these swamps are covered with a dense growth of reeds and
water-weeds. Of these, the most important is the papyrus, which
grows in great abundance, and often reaches a height of 10 to 16
feet. Once the papyrus was common in Egypt, but now it is not found
north of Abu Zeid, 190 miles south of Khartoum. In Europe it is not
found, except on the river Anapo in Sicily, where, however, it does
not attain anything like the same luxuriant growth. There are also
great stretches of the reed called in Arabic ‘um soof,’ or the
mother of wool. It is no wonder that the party sent by Nero to
explore the river was intimidated by these interminable forests of
papyrus and reeds, and turned back. No travellers have a good word
to say for this country, unless they only pass through it extremely
quickly. It is monotonous and desolate in the extreme, the
air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> is always hot
and steamy, and after dark mosquitoes rage in countless
myriads.</p>

<p>As far as Shambe the banks of the river are fairly well defined,
but there are numbers of breaches in them, through which the water
spills into the marshes. In a distance of seventy-five miles Sir W.
Garstin counted 129 of these breaches, usually about 4 yards wide;
nearly all of these were on the eastern side. These channels are
deeply cut with vertical sides, as if dug by hand, and the loss of
water through them is very great. The marshes on the eastern side
drain off into the Bahr el Zeraf, which takes off near Shambe, and,
cutting off the corner, rejoins the Nile below Lake No. Greatly
diminished by this loss, the Bahr el Gebel continues on its way,
its bank being often nothing more than a line of papyrus separating
it from large lagoons or dense thickets of reeds. As long as the
channel is clear, tortuous and winding though it is, a great deal
of water is able to pass; but under certain circumstances the
channel becomes blocked by bars of solid vegetable matter, called
sudd. Upstream of the obstruction the level rises, and, spreading
out over the marshes, more and more water is lost in
evaporation.</p>

<p>Sudd occurs both in the Bahr el Ghazal and the Bahr el Gebel,
but it is of different kinds. The Ghazal sudd is very much less
substantial than that of the Gebel. It is chiefly composed of
masses of the smaller swimming plants, which grow in Lake Ambadi
and other shallow lagoons on that river and its affluents. But on
the Gebel the principal constituents of the sudd are the papyrus
and the ‘um soof’ reed. Both these plants<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_127">[127]</span> grow with their roots bedded in the soil
below the shallow water of the lagoons. Strong gales are prevalent
in these latitudes, and these loosen the roots, so that, if the
storms are accompanied by flood, large masses of the plants are set
free, and begin drifting over the lagoons. Quantities of earth
remain clinging to their drifting roots, and thus they are driven
backwards and forwards by the wind. The storms come generally just
before the flood, and thus there is plenty of water for the reeds
to float in. Eventually they are driven, whole acres at a time,
into the channel of the river, and are carried down the stream. But
the channel being very narrow and winding, they soon get caught up,
and a block occurs. New masses come down, and these are sucked by
the stream under the original block, till a dense mass is formed,
sometimes as much as over 20 feet thick, and so solid that a man
can walk over it. If left to themselves, these blocks may last a
very long time, and cause the river to change its course; or else
by increased pressure the block is burst, and a great wave passes
down the river, which sweeps all other blocks away. Years of high
flood are generally followed by a great deal of sudd.</p>

<p>It appears that the conditions on the river between Lake No and
Shambe are much more favourable to blocking by sudd than they used
to be. In 1840 Mehemet Ali sent a scientific expedition under
D’Arnaud to explore the White Nile. At that time the main stream
through the sudd country was much bigger and stronger. No mention
is made of the Bahr el Zeraf at all, which looks as though it was
of much less importance,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_128">[128]</span> at any rate. They noticed, however, a
number of openings in the banks between the river and the swamps,
some natural, but some artificial, made by the natives for fishing
purposes. It is plausibly argued by Sir W. Willcocks that these
openings were later widened by the natives to enable them to escape
in their canoes from the slave-dealers, and then by the
slave-dealers themselves, escaping in their turn from Government
patrol boats. All these spills would drain into the Bahr el Zeraf,
which gradually became a navigable stream in its lower part. In
1863 Sir Samuel Baker ascended the Bahr el Gebel without any
difficulty; but in that year there was a very high flood and a
great deal of sudd. Returning in 1865, Baker found the river north
of Lake No considerably blocked. In 1870 Baker was unable to ascend
the Bahr el Gebel with his expedition to Equatoria, and went by the
Bahr el Zeraf. He cut through the sudd in that stream with
prodigious labour, and had finally to cut a ditch through 2,000
feet of solid clay. Even then the Bahr Zeraf level was so much
below that of the Bahr el Gebel that he could not get his boats
through until he had dammed the Zeraf behind them so as to lift
them up. In 1873 he says he found the canals much improved by the
force of the stream. All this naturally contributed to weaken the
power of the main stream and render it very liable to sudding.</p>

<p>In 1874, when the river was low, the sudd was cleared away by
Ismail Pasha Ayoub, then Governor-General of the Soudan, and all
through Gordon’s time in Equatoria there was free passage, but the
channel had dwindled very much.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_129">[129]</span> The heavy flood of 1878 brought the sudd
down again worse than ever, where it remained until cleared by
Marno in 1880. It was in that year that Gessi, on his way back from
his province, was caught and suffered such hardships in the sudd on
the Bahr el Ghazal. He was only rescued by the appearance of Marno.
Unfortunately, no record has been left of the methods which Marno
employed in the work, but he spoke of it as quite an easy
matter.</p>

<p>Little is known of the state of the sudd during the years of the
Mahdi and the Khalifa; but in 1898 Lord Kitchener found the Bahr el
Gebel blocked by sudd immediately above Lake No; and about the same
time Colonel Martyr, coming from Uganda, was unable to penetrate
more than 20 miles north of Shambe for the same reason. As soon as
the Khalifa had been finally crushed, operations to clear the
channel were immediately undertaken. In the first three months a
length of 80 miles of river had been cleared, including 5 miles of
actual sudd in eleven blocks, besides three more blocks which broke
away of themselves. The blocks that came away of themselves
represented a very large amount of sudd. After one of them had
burst, the floating weed took thirty-six hours to pass a given
point. The effect produced by the sudd in damming up the river is
illustrated by the fact that when the third block, which was nearly
20 feet thick, was removed, the upstream level fell 5 feet in four
days, and all the swamps and lagoons began to drain into the
river.</p>

<p>The amount of labour was prodigious. At one place, owing to the
enormous masses of um soof<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_130">[130]</span> and papyrus that kept pressing into the
river, no less than eleven clearances had to be made in one year.
Five gunboats and 800 dervish prisoners, besides officers and
guards, were employed. Sir W. Garstin gives an interesting
description of the methods by which the sudd was removed:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>‘In the first place, the papyrus and reeds on its surface were
burnt (curious to relate, these green reeds burn readily when the
marsh is dry), and in a few hours’ time the surface of the sudd was
an expanse of blackened stalks and ashes. As soon as the fire had
died down, gangs of men were landed from the steamer and employed
in cutting trenches on the surface of the sudd. These trenches
averaged from 0·60 to 0·80 metre in width, and from 1 to 1·25
metres in depth—<i>i.e.</i>, as deep as the men could work. The
surface was thus divided into a number of rectangular blocks some 3
metres by 4 metres. To these blocks were attached, one by one,
steel hawsers and chains. This done, the steamer downstream went
full speed astern. It invariably took several pulls to detach a
block, and in some instances as many as nine were necessary. Both
hawsers and chains kept constantly breaking, although the former
were calculated to stand a strain of 35 tons per square inch, and
the latter as much as 60 tons. As soon as a block was detached from
the mass, it was allowed to float downstream. It was curious to see
the green reeds and papyrus which had been confined beneath it
reappear on the surface of the water. A horrible stench prevailed
from the rotting vegetation.’</p>
</div>

<p>In 1900-1901 four more blocks were removed. An experiment was
made to break up one of the blocks by means of explosives, but it
was found that the sudd, though very solid, was too elastic, and
the only effect was to make large holes in it and no more. The old
method had to be once<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_131">[131]</span> more resorted to. By the end of 1901 only
23 miles of the channel remained uncleared, but this proved to be
the most difficult of all. One block was actually 7 miles in
length. Portions of the sudd had rotted, and, sinking to the
bottom, completely filled up the channel, so that there was no
stream at all, and it was impossible to tow pieces away and float
them downstream by the usual process. To get up the river it is
still necessary to go round by a series of lagoons, in which
navigation is difficult, and operations have been suspended for the
present.</p>

<p>The sudd in the Bahr el Ghazal was much easier to remove, and
great progress has been made, so that now the whole of that river
is free, and boats can even ascend the Jur River to Wau.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to ascertain the precise effect of the
removal of the sudd on the water-level in Egypt. But it is certain
that as each block was removed a quantity of water drained off the
marshes and helped to diminish the fall of the river in summers of
very small supply. Most of this water, spread out over a large
surface, must otherwise have been evaporated and lost altogether.
There can be no doubt that the improvement of the channel has been
a permanent gain to Egypt of a very substantial kind, to say
nothing of the advantage to the Soudan from the opening up of such
an important line of communication. Those who laboured at the task
deserve the highest praise. The river was so low that all
communication with Khartoum was cut off for several months, and
transport of supplies was always difficult. Besides this, the
climate is always unhealthy, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_132">[132]</span> the mosquitoes at night are almost beyond
endurance.</p>

<p>Under present conditions it will require constant care and
watchfulness, especially in years of high flood, to prevent the
sudd from frequently obstructing the river. But if the danger is to
be permanently removed, the main channel must be so much improved
by widening and deepening it that it will carry a greater volume.
This will at the same time prevent the water from being dissipated
in the marshes, and diminish the chances of any obstruction. The
necessity for some work of this kind, if there is to be a reservoir
at Lake Albert or Lake Victoria, has already been referred to. The
clearing of the sudd is only the essential preliminary to the
greater scheme.</p>

<p>One point remains to be noticed. Under the old basin system in
Egypt there could hardly be too high a flood, nor did a low summer
Nile create any extraordinary difficulties when there was so little
summer cultivation. But with perennial irrigation a high flood
becomes a matter of supreme anxiety, and the preservation of its
dykes is the anxious care of every village. On the other hand, all
the schemes for reservoirs aim at increasing the summer supply. If
the Bahr el Gebel was trained so as to bring down more water in
summer, it would also bring down more in flood, though the swamps
would still act as an escape for the waters beyond a certain rise.
It might therefore become a matter of great importance to Egypt to
actually diminish the supply during the flood, especially as year
by year more of the basin land is converted to perennial
irrigation. Regulators at Lakes Victoria<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_133">[133]</span> and Albert would serve in some degree for
flood protection as well as for storage against summer use. It is
calculated that the complete closing of the outlet of Lake Victoria
at the Ripon Falls would only raise the surface of the lake 20
inches in a year. But it would be far more effective if some of the
flood-waters of the rivers—<i>e.g.</i>, the Blue Nile and the
Atbara—which are fed by the rains of Abyssinia could be intercepted
before they reached Egypt. A large irrigation during the flood and
early winter along the Blue Nile might indeed actually lengthen out
the flood in Egypt, whilst depriving it of danger through excess at
any one period.</p>

"c13"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br>
<span class="less">THE UNITY OF NILELAND</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">It</span> is no longer possible to
think of our occupation of Egypt as merely a stepping-stone on the
road to India—‘the Englishman reaching far over to his loved
India.’ Still less can it be looked upon solely as a means for the
regeneration of Egypt and the education of her people till they are
able to pass from a state of tutelage and stand securely by
themselves. Certainly, great strides have been made in this
direction. If Egypt were the whole matter we might hope that in
time, but not in one or two generations, a race of native
administrators might rise up, to whom the affairs of that country
might safely be left. But Egypt is only a portion of the great
country of the Nile. Looking southward from Alexandria or Suez, the
horizon is only bounded by the sources of the Nile, and these do
not well up at Assouan, as Herodotus was told. We might hope that
the Egyptians would be capable of managing Egypt; but not the most
sanguine enthusiast could imagine a period of time sufficient to
make them capable of managing the Soudan. A cry of ‘The Soudan for
the Soudanese’ would hardly be more ridiculous. The story of the
binding of the Nile, incomplete as that story is at present, makes
one thing, at least, perfectly clear,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_135">[135]</span> and that is, that all Nileland is one
country. No divided sovereignty is possible; there must be one firm
hand over all.</p>

<p>It would have needed a preternaturally keen eye to perceive that
from the moment we began to patch the old Barrage the occupation of
the whole Valley of the Nile was inevitable. Looking back, it is
easy to see how it all followed in logical sequence. Everything
depended on the Nile. The more Egypt was developed, the greater
grew the need for the regulation of the water. The rulers of Egypt
need have troubled little about the fate of countries divided from
them by so many leagues of rainless desert, but for the link of the
all-important river.</p>

<p>It sounds a far cry from the snows of Ruwenzori, the lakes and
swamps of Equatorial Africa, or the rain-swept hills of Abyssinia,
to the cotton-mills of Lancashire. The Egyptian peasant, lifting
water on to the fields of the Delta, knows that the connection is
close enough. We have our own direct commercial interest in holding
the Valley of the Nile, and Egypt is still on the road to India.
Apart, therefore, from the duties which rest upon us as a civilized
Power, we are doubly responsible for the welfare of the people of
the Nileland.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago a distinguished English sailor travelled to
Khartoum and El Obeid, and published an account of his journey in a
little volume entitled ‘A Ride across the Nubian Desert.’ In
eloquent words he describes the wonders of the Nile’s course, and
continues:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>‘Surely the hand of the Almighty has traced it across the desert
that it might be the union of distant nations. . . .<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span> Its mission is not yet
accomplished; it is waiting to be the road to civilize Africa. But
it is not an Eastern nation, and not the Mohammedan religion that
can do it; and I am one of those who hope and believe that
Providence will destine it for England. An English Government and a
handful of Englishmen could do it. Cities would rise up at Assouan
and Khartoum, whose influence would be felt over the whole
interior. . . . I know, alas! the spirit of the age is against such
thoughts, and there are even men who would wish to abandon our
Empire; but I speak the voice of thousands of Englishmen who, like
myself, have served their country abroad, and who do not love her
least, who will never consent to relinquish an Empire that has been
won by the sword, and who think the best way to preserve it is
often by judicious extension.’</p>
</div>

<p>On many a stricken field the author of these prophetic words,
Captain Sir William Peel, V.C., the hero of the Naval Brigade in
the Crimea and the Mutiny, proved the sincerity of that love for
his country of which he spoke so warmly. And now, after so many
years and so many vicissitudes of fortune, an English Government
and a handful of Englishmen are grappling with the work on which
his heart was set.</p>

<span class="less">THE PAST</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">As</span> with modern Egypt, so
with the modern Soudan: the name of the Albanian tobacco-seller is
writ large upon the pages of her history. In spite of the ancient
connection between Egypt and Ethiopia, in spite of the dependence
of Egypt upon the Soudan for her water, the warlike tribes of the
south remained for more than 1,000 years free from any attempt at
domination by their neighbours. It was Mehemet Ali who, in the year
1819, laid the foundations of the empire which reached its furthest
limits under the Khedive Ismail, an empire of which the brief but
disastrous history brought nothing but misery and ruin to the
Soudanese, and made the Soudan a name of fear and trembling to
every Egyptian peasant.</p>

<p>About <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 700 Arabs of the tribe of
Beni Omr, driven out of Arabia, crossed the Red Sea, and began to
settle about Sennar, on the Blue Nile. By degrees these fugitives,
reinforced by other tribes, some from Arabia direct, some, it is
said, by way of Egypt and the countries further west, swelled to an
invading host and permeated the whole of the Northern Soudan, and
the original inhabitants were largely converted to Islam.
In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span> the Sennar
region the two principal negro tribes were the Fung and the Hameg.
The conquerors, while they imposed their language and religion on
the conquered, seemed to have been absorbed into their ranks; for
the distinction between Arab and negro diminished, and the old
tribal names reappeared. In 1493 Amara Dunkas, a sheikh of one of
the Fung tribes, was recognised as king of all the Fungs, and
conquered all the country on both sides of the Blue Nile from
Khartoum to Fazokhl. The negroes who remained in the country were
merged in the Fungs. The remainder emigrated to the mountains of
Southern Kordofan, where, under the name of Nubas, they have ever
since maintained themselves in a somewhat precarious independence
against the raids of the Arabs of the plains. About the same time
was founded the Sultanate of Darfur, which in time extended its
dominion to the banks of the Nile. South of these two powers the
Shilluks and other negro tribes continued, as before, generally
engaged in some petty warfare, and regarded as a convenient
reservoir of slaves by their Arab neighbours.</p>

<p>The Fung dynasty lasted 300 years, and attained a very
considerable position. About <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 1600 in
the reign of Adlan, Sennar even became famous for learning, and was
the resort of many scientists and philosophers from Cairo and
Bagdad. In the reign of King Baadi, 1719-1758, the fame of the
kingdom of Sennar reached its height. A quarrel arose with
Abyssinia on account of some presents from the King of France which
had been intercepted by Baadi. The Abyssinian King invaded Sennar
with a great host, but met with the most<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_141">[141]</span> signal defeat. So great an event was
heralded throughout the Mohammedan East. The bazaars of
Constantinople and Delhi were alike filled with the renown of
Sennar. Once more crowds of learned and celebrated men flocked into
the country from every quarter. But it was the last flicker of
sunlight before the night fell. Baadi himself was deposed and
exiled on account of his bad administration. The Hameg tribe, long
subject to the Fungs, began to lift their heads. By 1790 the
kingdom of the Fungs had disappeared, and for thirty years the
Hameg continued supreme. Fire and sword was their sole notion of
supremacy; it was no mere theory with them. The country was utterly
given over to anarchy when Mehemet Ali determined to interfere.</p>

<p>The motives that prompted him were many; possibly, ardent
irrigationist that he was, the desire to secure the upper waters of
the Nile may have been among them; but beyond a doubt, like
Cambyses of old, his principal object was gold. Extraordinary
rumours were current as to an El Dorado in the south. Every officer
and man who took part in the expedition entertained the most
extravagant notions of gold-strewn districts. By means of this, and
also by securing the profitable traffic in slaves, Mehemet hoped to
be able to win sufficient resources to carry out his ambitious
schemes in Asia and Europe. It was also very convenient at the
moment to find employment for his irregular troops. It would be a
mistake, however, to explain his action wholly by such reasons as
these. All through his life ran the dream of posing as a second
Napoleon. It is curious to find<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_142">[142]</span> that along with the army he sent a number
of learned men and skilled artisans, while it was announced that
the object of the invasion was to introduce the benefits of a
regular government of civilization. Mehemet Ali had closely studied
the methods of his great model.</p>

<p>But of all these designs only one, and that the worst, was
destined to be fulfilled. The slave-trade had always flourished in
the Soudan. The Arab States were founded upon slavery. Along the
great Arbain road, the desert ‘track of the forty days’ from Darfur
to Assiout, yearly caravans containing slaves as well as other
merchandise passed into Egypt; the Nile route served the same
purpose, and from the Red Sea ports there was a constant export
trade to Arabia and Turkey. All this was nothing compared to the
dimensions which the trade assumed under Egyptian rule. It became
practically the sole trade of the country; it reached like a
pestilential blight even as far as the Equator. Bitterly did the
Soudan suffer for the Napoleonic ideas of Mehemet, and bitter, but
deserved, was the penalty which Egypt had to pay for her
misgovernment in the end. Even to-day among the remotest tribes the
name of ‘Turk’ stands for loathing and terror.</p>

<p>The army, commanded by Ismail, son of the Viceroy, reached
Sennar without opposition. Thence, accompanied by his brother
Ibrahim, he advanced to Fazokhl in search of the famous gold-mines
in the Beni Shangul. But the gold proved disappointing. Ibrahim
returned to Egypt, destined to win fame as the butcher of the
Peloponnese in the Greek War of Independence. The<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> Arabs rose against Ismail, and
he had to return to defeat them. Unsuccessful in his quest for
gold, he had devoted all his energy to the slave-trade, but his
cruelties and barbarities were too much even for a people familiar
with the Hameg. The local chief at Shendi, appropriately named El
Nemr (the Tiger), invited him to a banquet. While he and his
followers, contrary to the precepts of their own Koran, drank
freely of the forbidden wine, straw was silently piled high about
the house and fired. To a man they perished in the flames.</p>

<p>Meantime, Achmet Bey, the Defterdar, had conquered the province
of Kordofan from the Sultan of Darfur. Hearing of Ismail’s fate, he
marched towards Shendi to avenge him. The story of what happened,
as told by the Egyptians, wears an ugly look. The details are
wanting, but, at any rate, few were left to tell the other side of
the story. At Metemmeh, on the bank of the Nile opposite Shendi,
the people sent messengers to sue for pardon. It was granted. But
when the Defterdar marched into the town a lance was thrown at him.
The pardon was at once rescinded, and a general massacre ensued. El
Nemr himself, however, had fled to Abyssinia. He, at any rate, had
no faith in Egyptian promises. The Defterdar then marched towards
Khartoum, and at Tuti Island another great slaughter took place. It
was a bad beginning. To the native Soudanese the distinction
between the benefits of a regular government of civilization and
the fire and sword of the Hameg must have seemed slight indeed.</p>

<p>To build aright on such foundations would have<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span> been difficult for a nation of
born administrators. For the Egyptians it was impossible. There
were among the Egyptian Governors of the Soudan honest and
righteous men, but, amid a crowd of officials bred and trained in
an atmosphere of corruption and slavery, their spasmodic efforts
after good only gave fresh opportunities for evil. Military
stations were established in various parts of the country for the
sake of security, and they became fountains of slave recruits to
swell the ranks of the army. The navigation of the White Nile was
declared free, and it became the favourite route of the
slave-traders. Khartoum, from a village of skins and reeds, rose to
be a city of bricks and the capital of the Soudan, but also a
convenient and central market for a huge slave-trade. The
Abyssinians, who espoused the cause of the Sennar rebels, were
beaten back into their mountains, but the savage methods of warfare
only brutalized and demoralized the victors. It speaks volumes for
the barbarous character of the times that when Adlan, the leader of
the Abyssinians, was captured by Kurshid, reputed the best of the
Governors of the Soudan, he was immediately impaled. The annals of
these years are filled with stories of famine and rebellion, and,
to add to the general desolation, cholera and other diseases
constantly ravaged the country.</p>

<p>But worse was to come. Down to 1853 the southernmost Egyptian
station was only 120 miles south of Khartoum. The annexed provinces
of Kordofan, Sennar, and Kassala (or Taka) groaned under oppression
and tyranny, but the negro inhabitants of the Upper White Nile and
the Bahr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> el Ghazal
were still comparatively unmolested. In that year the English
Consul in the Soudan started a trading expedition up the river.
Other traders followed, who established stations far up the
country. Peaceful trading soon succumbed to the temptations of the
slave-trade. For the sake of protection, it began to be found
necessary to employ bands of armed Arabs or Nubians. Gradually the
European traders disappeared; by 1860 the last of them had sold
their stations to their Arab agents. No greater curse was ever let
loose upon a country than these human locusts, and the Egyptian
Government was directly responsible. Under the shallow pretence of
legitimate commerce, trading monopolies were leased to these
traders in various districts. The fact that the Government had not
a shadow of claim even by right of conquest to the territories
leased was no obstacle. All the country south of Kordofan and
Darfur along the White Nile or the Bahr el Ghazal was regarded as
peculiarly suitable for these nefarious bargains. The Khartoumers,
as they were called, because they had their headquarters in the
capital, established themselves everywhere, and became practically
independent potentates. With their armed bands of brigands they
raided the native tribes, and even used them to fight against each
other. Only the Dinkas, protected by the impenetrable marshes of
the sudd region, and the powerful and warlike Azande, or Niam-Niam,
in the south, were able to maintain themselves. But the Bongo, a
numerous and peaceful agricultural people, were easily reduced. The
fact that they had attained a higher civilization<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span> than their neighbours (for
they smelted the iron found in their swamps with furnaces of clay
and rude bellows, and worked it with stone hammers on anvils of
granite, made pottery, and even had some acquaintance with surgery)
only made them the more valuable in the slave-market. The Jur,
Dembo, and Golo tribes were likewise among the principal sufferers.
Anarchy is but a mild term for the condition of affairs.</p>

<p>Some of these unhappy victims may have heard the news on their
way to the northern slave-market that slavery was abolished in the
Soudan. If so, it cannot have done much to sweeten their bondage or
to heal the strokes of the lash, yet a viceregal decree to that
effect had been solemnly promulgated at Berber in 1857. It was
characteristic of many of the descendants of Mehemet Ali that they
inherited great part of his intellectual vigour and wide sweep of
imagination without any of his executive capacity. Said Pasha, who
became Viceroy in 1854, visited the Soudan and clearly recognised
the failure of his foreign empire. A large force had to be
maintained to screw exorbitant demands out of a discontented
population. Agriculture was depressed, and every other industry was
perishing under a system of taxation vicious in itself, and
collected by methods which might have made a Verres blush. He
determined to evacuate the country. But the burden of the Soudan,
so lightly taken up in greed of gain, was not to be so lightly laid
aside. Egypt was now holding a wolf by the ears. The officials who
battened on the ruin of the country opposed a strenuous resistance.
Things had come to such a pass that the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_147">[147]</span> sheikhs and notables of the provinces
themselves feared that the withdrawal of one devil would be
followed by the entry of many. Said contented himself with
reorganizing the government and announcing a number of reforms of a
drastic and far-reaching nature, and then returned to Egypt. It was
the first of many reorganizations and many reforms, all of which
were as effective as the decree for the abolition of slavery. The
plan of much talking and little doing became a fixed principle of
Soudan policy.</p>

<p>The story of the tax on sakiehs (water-wheels) affords a good
illustration of Egyptian methods. One of Said’s reforms was to fix
this tax at 200 piastres per annum. In less than nine years it had
risen to 500 piastres. Jaaffar Pasha, who finally raised it to this
extent, declared openly that he fixed it at that rate in order to
see how much the peasants would really pay, and he hoped after a
three years’ trial to be able to arrive at a just assessment. It
was not a very scientific plan of taxation in any case, but,
unfortunately, Jaaffar was removed before the scheme had time to
work out, and his successors, absolutely indifferent to his
motives, retained the tax, and even further increased it. It was
calculated that on average land the tax often far exceeded the net
returns for one sakieh. Even a ruined wheel was liable to the full
amount, and if an owner returned to it after an interval he was
saddled with the whole of the arrears. On the same principle taxes
continued to be charged on land and trees that had long since been
carried away by the floods. The natural results followed. Many
cultivators were ruined and reduced to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_148">[148]</span> beggary, others fled the country, and much
land went out of cultivation. In 1881 more than 2,000 sakiehs were
lying derelict in Berber and Dongola.</p>

<p>By the time Ismail Pasha came to the throne in 1863 it had
become abundantly clear that the Egyptians were unfit to govern the
Soudan. It looked as though in a few years the whole country would
have become a wilderness, totally uninhabited save for a few
wanderers, whose sole occupation would be selling each other into
slavery. And yet the next few years witnessed an enormous extension
of the Egyptian Empire, and Ismail himself enjoyed, until the
bubble burst, a great reputation as a genuine and whole-hearted
reformer. Nor was that reputation wholly undeserved. Strange
compound that he was of vast ambitions but changeable resolution,
of far-reaching sagacity but reckless carelessness, a Westerner in
the conception of his ideals but an Oriental in every sense in his
pursuit of them, he proved himself in his treatment of the Soudan,
as in other spheres, to possess many of the elements of greatness.
If he failed, it was partly because the evil was beyond cure: the
impending catastrophe was too great to be averted. His employment
of Baker and Gordon and other Europeans showed that he realized the
incapacity of Egypt to perform the task by herself. That was in
itself a great step forward; undoubtedly it staved off for a little
the day of retribution. His eager support of the project of a
railway to Khartoum, first mooted by his predecessor, Said, showed
a sound appreciation of the position, though his ineffective
attempts to carry it out showed his weakness as clearly. But the
whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span> hierarchy of
Egyptian officialdom was rotten to the core. The best of rulers
without good ministers is predestined to failure.</p>

<p>To add to a falling house must always be a desperate remedy. No
other course seemed open to Ismail, if he was really to cope with
the slave-trade. So long as the basin of the Upper Nile remained in
the hands of the ‘Khartoumers,’ the sources of the traffic flowed
as briskly as ever, and at the same time the Red Sea ports afforded
every facility for export. Accordingly, in 1866 Ismail purchased
the districts of Suakin and Massowah from the Turks by an increase
of tribute. In 1869 he took a still more important step, and
determined to annex the whole basin of the Nile. He invested Sir S.
Baker with absolute and despotic powers over the whole country
south of Gondokoro. No better choice could have been made. An
administrator of the best type, energetic and high-minded, Baker
was also no stranger to the scene of his mission. He had already in
1861 conducted an expedition up the White Nile to join hands with
Speke and Grant in their investigations of the sources of the Nile,
and in 1864 he had discovered the Albert Nyanza.</p>

<p>A strong man was needed. The Khedive seemed in earnest, but he
was occupied with the Suez Canal and other matters nearer home. His
representatives in Khartoum took quite another view; it was the
custom of the Soudan Government to take away with one hand what it
gave with the other. Baker’s appointment bore the ominous date of
April 1, and the fact may well have recurred to him when, on
arriving at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
Khartoum towards the close of the year, he discovered that the
territory he was sent to annex had already been leased by the
Governor-General to a couple of notorious slave-dealers. Every
conceivable obstacle was put in his way by the officials. But, in
spite of all opposition, he organized his expedition, and after a
journey of incredible difficulty and labour, for the real channel
of the river was blocked by sudd, he reached Gondokoro in May,
1871, and formally annexed it as ‘Ismailia.’ Next year he passed
south, and proclaimed Unyoro an Egyptian province, organized a
number of military posts, and entered into friendly relations with
M’tesa, King of Uganda. For the time the slave-traffic in these new
provinces was crushed. In 1873 Baker returned to Cairo with a
record of successful work behind him, which must have astonished no
one more than the Khedive himself.</p>

<p>But once the strong hand was removed, the stone which had been
heaved uphill with so much labour rolled swiftly down again. Less
than a year elapsed between the departure of Baker and the arrival
of Colonel Gordon, on his appointment as Governor-General of
Equatoria. Even in that short time the Egyptian occupation had
become merely nominal. Two posts only were held, Gondokoro and
Fatiko. Three large slave-trading stations were in full swing on
the Bahr el Zeraf alone, whilst on the Bahr el Ghazal the notorious
Zubehr had established himself as a practically independent
potentate, and was even preparing on his own account an invasion of
Darfur. The situation called forth Gordon’s fullest
energies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span> Never did
he perform better work than during his three years in Equatoria. As
far as it could be done under Egyptian supremacy, he checked the
slave-trade and laid the foundations of good government. The
country was organized and divided into districts with proper
garrisons both along the Sobat and the White Nile. The tribes were
peaceful and contented. Communication was established with the
great lakes; Lake Albert Nyanza was for the first time
circumnavigated. A treaty was made with M’tesa, King of Uganda,
recognising his independence, and Emin Bey was sent to represent
Egypt at his Court. In 1876 Gordon returned to England.</p>

<p>In Egypt, meantime, the Khedive’s reckless extravagance was fast
hurrying him to disaster. But the more involved he became, the more
he extended his ambitions, like a ruined spendthrift who must keep
up his credit at any cost. Extension of his Empire became a mania.
After Equatoria came the turn of Darfur in 1874. Darfur had
maintained its independence for over 400 years under an unbroken
line of Sultans. One of them, Abd-el-Rahman the Just, had entered
into correspondence with Napoleon during his occupation of Egypt,
and congratulated him upon his defeat of the Mamelukes. Napoleon
replied in a remarkable letter:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p class="hang1"><em>‘To the Sultan of Darfur, 12 Messidor, Year
VII. In the Name of God, compassionate and merciful; there is no
other God but God! To the Sultan of Darfur, Abd-el-Rahman.</em>
</p>

<p>‘I have received your letter, and understand its purport. When
your caravan arrived I was absent in Syria punishing<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span> and destroying my enemies. I
pray you send me by the first caravan 2,000 black slaves, over
sixteen years of age, healthy and strong. I will buy them from you.
Order your caravan to come immediately, without delay. I have given
orders for its protection all along the route.</p>

<div class="sign-block width12">
<p>‘<span class="sc">Bonaparte</span>,
‘<em>Commander-in-Chief</em>.’</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many motives combined to make Ismail desire the annexation of
the country. There were longstanding frontier grievances. Its
commerce and slave-trade were still considerable, and Ismail hoped
to profit by the one as well as to suppress the other. The
copper-mines of Hofrat-en-Nahas in Southern Darfur were also a
powerful attraction in view of his failing treasury. They were
reported to be extraordinarily rich, with veins standing 2 feet out
of the ground. And, since Zubehr could not be prevented from his
proposed expedition, the only course seemed to be to join him in
the conquest. Accordingly, an expedition was despatched from the
north, while Zubehr co-operated from the south. The Sultan and two
of his sons were killed in battle, and another troublesome province
was added to the Khedive’s dominions. Zubehr was made a Pasha, but
was refused the governorship, which he claimed as his right. For a
moment he seemed inclined to assert his independence, but in the
end he rashly determined to press his case in person at Cairo,
leaving his son Suleiman to fill his place in his absence.</p>

<p>The same year saw the annexation of Harrar at the request of the
Mohammedans in that country. Raouf Pasha, who had been left in
charge at Gondokoro after Baker’s departure, was sent
for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span> that purpose.
He showed that he had learnt but little wisdom or mercy from his
association with Baker and Gordon, for he commenced his
administration by strangling the late Sultan, a wholly unnecessary
act. Egyptian territory had been extending down the Red Sea coast
for some years previously, at the expense of Abyssinia. Little was
gained, except some friction with the King of Abyssinia, for the
occupation was generally quite nominal, and the tributes imposed by
Egypt were seldom or never paid. Still, Egypt now possessed the
coast-line as far as the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, and the purchase
of the port of Zeila from Turkey in 1875 extended her possessions
to Cape Guardafui and beyond, and consolidated her position, such
as it was, in Harrar, and what is now Somaliland. But even this did
not satisfy the Khedive.</p>

<p>Gordon had clearly perceived that it was impossible to properly
control the Equatorial provinces without an outlet to the Indian
Ocean, to replace the long and precarious line of communication by
the Nile. He therefore advised the Khedive to occupy Mombasa from
the sea, while he himself co-operated from inland by way of the
Victoria Nyanza. Although the difficult nature of the country and
the inferior quality of his troops soon convinced Gordon that it
was impossible for him to carry out his part in the project, a
naval expedition, known as the Juba River Expedition, set out in
1875 under the command of McKillop Pasha. Missing the mouth of the
Juba River, which had been selected by the Khedive as their
objective, without any great knowledge of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_154">[154]</span> geography of these regions, they ran
further south, but encroached on the territory of the Sultan of
Zanzibar. At the instance of Great Britain the expedition was given
up, but no objection was raised to the recognition of the Khedive’s
authority as far south as the tenth degree of latitude.</p>

<p>It was not long before the folly of all this extravagant
expansion began to appear. Abyssinia had had many causes of quarrel
with Egypt, and, in fact, the relations between the two countries
had consisted of a state of intermittent war or at best armed
neutrality since the time of Mehemet Ali. But the purchase of Zeila
thoroughly alarmed King John, and he took steps to protect his
rights. War followed, disastrous to Egypt. A first army under
Arendrup, a Dane, was, after a few preliminary successes, totally
annihilated. A second was hastily fitted out and despatched. It was
a model of all an army should not be, and had not King John been
diverted by the fear of his rebellious vassal, Menelik, it would no
doubt have suffered the fate of the first. As it was, it managed to
return to Massowah after two or three months’ tedious and
inglorious campaigning and one severe defeat.</p>

<p>The falling house had been extended in every direction, but it
was falling still. The Abyssinian trouble was not the only sign of
weakness. The internal condition of the provinces was as bad as
ever; the whole country was restless and disturbed; the feebleness
of the Government was increased by the huge distances over which
its garrisons were scattered; the slave-trade, openly favoured by
the officials whose duty it was to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_155">[155]</span> suppress it, was recovering from the blows
which had been dealt it. One more heroic effort was made to set
things right. Gordon was recalled to Egypt and made
Governor-General of the whole Soudan, including Equatoria and the
Red Sea provinces. He was specially charged with the duty of
settling matters with Abyssinia, of suppressing the slave-trade,
and of improving communications.</p>

<p>It was with the utmost reluctance that Gordon returned to the
Soudan. Under existing conditions his task was a hopeless one, and
he knew it. His letters show how clearly he foresaw the coming
catastrophe. He was aware that, while the Egyptian Government was
concluding an anti-slavery convention with England, it was at the
same time intriguing almost openly with Zubehr, the prince of
slave-dealers. Less than half-hearted support was to be expected
from Cairo. At the very moment that he needed them most, great part
of his troops were withdrawn to serve in the Russo-Turkish War.
Immediately on assuming the reins of government he found himself
confronted by a serious rebellion in Darfur; at the same time the
slave-dealers in the south were gathering in force under the
leadership of Suleiman, Zubehr’s son. But Gordon faced the peril
undismayed. His activity was almost superhuman. Hastily patching up
a temporary arrangement on the Abyssinian frontier, he travelled to
Khartoum by way of Kassala, Gedaref, and Sennar. Here he spent some
time in carrying out a number of reforms, and in May set out to
deal with the rebellion in Darfur. Darfur had had its
first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span> experience of
Egyptian rule, and Harûn, a member of the deposed royal house, had
taken advantage of the general discontent. There flocked also to
his standard the nomad Arab tribes, who had stood aloof when Darfur
was first conquered, but now saw their hereditary trade threatened.
But Gordon in a few months had drawn together his scattered
garrisons and scattered the rebels by a display of force. By the
almost unsupported exercise of his personal influence he next
dispersed the combination of slave-dealers under Suleiman, and by
the end of the year he was back again at Khartoum, after another
visit to the Abyssinian frontier and a round by Suakin and
Berber.</p>

<p>Early in the next year he made the tour of all the Red Sea
provinces, including Harrar. But in spite of all this ceaseless
activity, the close of the year 1878 found things worse than ever.
Trouble was once more stirring on the Abyssinian frontier. The
northern provinces were quiet, but their quiet was the torpor of
exhaustion. In Darfur Harûn had once more reappeared, and in
Kordofan, too, a rising had taken place. In the Bahr el Ghazal
Suleiman had this time revolted in good earnest. Only Equatoria was
comparatively happy under the rule of Emin. Unyoro had been given
up, and the Somerset Nile was now the southern boundary. Gessi had
been despatched by Gordon to the Bahr el Ghazal, and in March he
himself undertook an expedition to Kordofan and Darfur, with the
object of pacifying the country and preventing help being sent to
Suleiman. At the same time he made great efforts to put down the
slave-trade, and captured many caravans. In June he<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span> was able to return to
Khartoum, and left for Cairo to confer with the new Khedive Tewfik.
The short remainder of his time as Governor-General was occupied
with his mission to Abyssinia, and in December he left for
England.</p>

<p>Meantime Gessi had been performing marvels in the Bahr el
Ghazal. Gessi is one of the heroic figures of Soudan history. An
Italian by birth, he served in the Crimea as interpreter to the
British troops. In 1874 he joined Gordon in Central Africa. Thanks
to his energy, a dangerous rising of the Shilluks at Fashoda was
put down, and it was he who circumnavigated Lake Albert. The rising
he had now to face was most serious. Zubehr, before he left for
Cairo after the conquest of Darfur, had assembled his officers and
made them swear to revolt when he should send them word that the
time was ripe. That time was now come. Their organization was
complete; their following was numerous and well-equipped; they had
already proved the incapacity of the Government troops. It seemed
that there was nothing to stop them from dividing the Soudan
provinces among themselves, and finally throwing off the yoke of
the hated and despised Egyptian. They even announced that they
intended to seize Egypt itself. But they had reckoned without
Gessi. With a handful of troops, inferior in quality as well as in
number, short of supplies and ammunition, impeded by floods and
generally cut off from his base by the sudd, in two notable
campaigns he utterly broke their power, seized and shot Suleiman
and his principal confederates, and completely liberated the Bahr
el Ghazal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>His end was
characteristic of the fate of those who, in those dark days, dared
to serve the best interests of Egypt. In spite of his successful
administration of his province, he found his position made
impossible for him after Gordon’s departure. In September, 1880, he
resigned. After nearly perishing in the sudd, which blocked his
steamers, he reached Khartoum. But there, under the new regime, he
was no welcome guest. He struggled on to Suez, where he soon after
died, unrecognised and unrewarded, utterly worn out by his
exertions and privations. When such a man met with such treatment,
it was clear that there was no chance of the regeneration of the
Soudan under Egyptian rule. The last ray of hope had been
extinguished with Gordon’s departure.</p>

"c15"></a>CHAPTER XV<br>
<span class="less">THE PAST—<em>Continued</em></span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Gordon’s</span> successor at
Khartoum was Raouf Pasha, the very man whom he had dismissed from
his post as Governor of Harrar two years before for oppression and
other malpractices. The appointment was not of good augury, and the
improvements which had been made in the administration fell rapidly
to pieces. The slave-traders began to lift their heads; once more
the caravans, with their miserable human freight, began to journey
towards Egypt or the Red Sea; once more the horde of tax-collectors
felt themselves set free to levy their exactions at their will. The
critical position of affairs in Egypt itself was reflected in the
Soudan. Economy and retrenchment were the order of the day; under
such a Government they were not likely to mean anything else than
an increase in the burden on the provinces. Colonel Stewart, in his
report on the Soudan, published in 1883, graphically describes the
character of the irregular Bashi-Bazouks who were employed to
collect the taxes.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>‘Many, if not most of these men,’ he says, ‘are very indifferent
characters. They are mostly swaggering bullies,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span> robbing, plundering, and
ill-treating the people with impunity. Probably for every pound
that reaches the Treasury they rob an equal amount from the people.
They are a constant menace to public tranquillity, and before any
amelioration can be expected they must be got rid of. As soldiers
they are valueless, having no discipline, nor, except in talk, do
they exhibit any extraordinary courage. Compared with that of
negroes and Egyptians their pay is high.’</p>
</div>

<p>A last paper reorganization took place in 1882. Schools were to
be set up, a proper system of justice established, the slave-trade
was to be again suppressed. A capable Governor-General,
Abd-el-Kader, who might have made a great mark in happier times,
was appointed to supersede Raouf. But it was too late. The promised
reforms could be no more than acknowledgments of past deficiencies.
Egypt had wasted the golden opportunities created for her by Baker
and Gordon. The day of retribution was at hand. From every quarter
of the horizon the clouds had long been gathering, and the tempest
was now to burst. In August, 1881, the Mahdi had proclaimed himself
publicly during the Feast of Ramadan as the prophet foretold by
Mahomet.</p>

<p>Sheikh Mohammed Ahmed, strangely enough the son of a carpenter,
and a little over thirty years of age, was a native of Dongola, but
had been living for some time in the neighbourhood of Khartoum,
where he had acquired a great reputation for sanctity. The Soudan
was then, and still is, a soil peculiarly suitable for the growth
of prophets. The creed of Islam, as is well known, has a peculiar
fascination for the natives of Africa,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_161">[161]</span> owing, perhaps, to the simplicity and
directness of its essential formula. But it has generally only
overlaid, and not displaced, the old superstitions of pagan days.
The people are naturally credulous and excitable, and in the entire
absence of any education or learning there has been nothing to
restrain them. Almost any holy man can gain some kind of a
following—at any rate for a time. But the Mahdi was more than an
ordinary prophet, and the times were ripe for rebellion.</p>

<p>The venality and corruption of the Egyptian officials had
produced widespread discontent among the agricultural and trading
classes. The oppressive exactions of the tax-collectors had reduced
many to ruin and beggary. It seemed that any change of rulers must
be a relief. The spasmodic efforts to suppress the slave-trade had
seriously alarmed the nomad tribes, whose chief source of wealth it
was. The one thing wanted was some strong influence to bind
together the discordant elements of revolt. It was found in the
idea preached by the Mahdi of the regeneration of Islam by force of
arms. After the long years of wrong and oppression the promise of
universal equality, with one law and one religion for all, was
sweet to hear. To the people that sat in darkness it seemed that a
great light had indeed arisen. The four great sects of the
Mohammedan Soudan sank their differences in favour of the Prophet
of the new dispensation. The stern character of his teaching, his
earnest denunciation of earthly vanities and pleasures, his
prohibition of the use of intoxicants and smoking, did much at the
outset to rouse the fanatical fervour of his<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_162">[162]</span> adherents. It was a social as well as a
religious revolution. The simple jibbeh, or cotton shirt, became
the badge of his followers and the emblem of his doctrine.</p>

<p>The course adopted by the Egyptian authorities was well
calculated to increase his prestige. First they ignored, then they
underrated, his power. Feeble attempts were made to seize him,
which failed utterly. At first Sennar was the centre of
disturbance; a little later the Mahdi appeared in Southern
Kordofan. A small force of regulars was sent against him in
December, 1881; they fell into an ambush and were utterly
destroyed. In June, 1882, Yusuf Pasha, Governor of Fashoda, with
several thousand men, set out to crush him finally. Yusuf had
distinguished himself in Gessi’s famous campaign. That an
experienced leader of disciplined troops could have anything to
fear from a crowd of half-naked Arabs seemed to him utterly
impossible; so he neglected every precaution, with the inevitable
result of annihilation. Throughout the Soudan it was regarded as
little less than a miracle. The warlike tribes of the west began to
flock to the Mahdi’s standard. His fame spread to the farthest
extremities of Darfur. By the end of 1882 he had three armies in
the field. Everywhere the Egyptian garrisons were beleaguered. The
hated tax-collectors and outlying bodies of troops were the first
to feel the vengeance of the rebels. Early in 1883 came the fall of
El Obeid, after a most gallant resistance under Mohamed Pasha Said.
The Egyptian Government made a desperate attempt to regain their
position. Hicks Pasha arrived at Khartoum with 10,000<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span> men, mostly raw recruits, and
advanced into Kordofan. Betrayed by their guides, suffering
terribly from heat and thirst, deficient alike in courage and
discipline, the expedition was beaten before it set out. On
November 5 the massacre, for it was nothing else, took place, and
only 300 survivors were left. The effect was tremendous. On the one
side it was decided to abandon the Soudan and withdraw all the
garrisons, and Gordon was sent to carry out this task; on the
other, a gigantic impulse was given to the cause of Mahdism.</p>

<p>Great as Gordon’s influence had once been, it was impossible for
it to outweigh the religious fervour of the Mahdists. His position
was immensely weakened when it became known that his final object
was the evacuation of the Soudan. Many waverers felt that they must
in the end be left at the mercy of the Mahdi, and wavered no more.
Gordon’s view was that the only way to evacuate the Soudan with
honour and safety was to hold on to Khartoum, crush the enemy if
possible, and then to retire, leaving behind some form of
government capable of maintaining order. The only man, in his
opinion, capable of such a position was Zubehr. But his views were
not shared, perhaps hardly understood, by the authorities at home.
The British Government, committed sorely against their will to a
military occupation of Egypt, and earnestly desiring to make it as
short as possible, were most unwilling to undertake further
responsibilities in the Soudan. The conflict of opinion produced
paralysis. Neither policy was completely adopted. British troops
moved up to Assouan. In the Eastern<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_164">[164]</span> Soudan the disaster of El Teb, where once
more the Egyptian troops under Valentine Baker allowed themselves
to be slaughtered like sheep, and the fall of Sinkat, forced the
Government to take military action. General Graham, starting from
Suakin, won brilliant victories at El Teb and Tamai, and relieved
the garrison at Tokar. But the proposal to make a dash on Berber,
now in the hands of the Mahdists, was vetoed, and Graham’s troops
retired. Meanwhile in the Nile Valley the golden hours were flying
fast. Gordon stood firmly by his policy of holding Khartoum, partly
in the hope, growing daily fainter, of being able to turn the scale
by his own personal exertions and influence, partly with the
intention of forcing the British Government to change what seemed
to him their disastrous and dishonourable policy of abandoning the
Soudan to the rebels. On their side, the Government drifted,
hesitating and temporizing, reluctant to reverse their settled
policy of peace. And so the tragic game was played. Month by month
the investment of Khartoum grew closer. Slatin Bey in Darfur, after
fighting twenty-seven battles in the course of 1883, was deserted
by his troops and forced to surrender. El Fasher was reduced in the
following January. In the Bahr el Ghazal, Lupton Bey, the successor
of Gessi, after holding out for eighteen months, shared the same
fate, and was brought in a prisoner to Omdurman. In the east the
garrison of Gedaref made terms with the enemy. The Mahdi was able
to concentrate his forces at the important point.</p>

<p>Only in August, 1884, a relief expedition was<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span> decided on, and at the end of
December two columns started from Korti, one along the Nile towards
Abu Hamed, the other across the desert by Gakdul Wells to Metemmeh
and Khartoum. But the effort that might have succeeded six months
earlier was too late. Two days before the relieving steamers
arrived the weak defences of Khartoum had been stormed, and Gordon
had fallen.</p>

<p>For the moment it seemed that Gordon’s death would do what he
himself could not do when alive. Great preparations were made for a
new campaign in the autumn. The columns, which had drawn back to
Merowe after much severe fighting, were quartered for the summer
along the river. General Graham was again despatched to Suakin with
orders to crush Osman Digna, and a railway from that place to
Berber was begun. For two months there was hard fighting at Hashin,
at McNeill’s Zeriba, and at Tamai. But the hot fit passed. The
railway, which had been begun without any survey, quite in the
familiar Egyptian fashion, was given up. The whole Nile Valley was
left unoccupied as far as Kosheh. The dervishes pushed on, and
occupied Dongola, and, though decisively beaten at Ginnis at the
end of the year, they continued to maintain a harassing border
warfare.</p>

<p>The Mahdi died in June, 1885, carried off by a malignant fever,
or, as some say, poisoned by a woman, whilst in the middle of his
preparations for the invasion of Egypt. His successor, the Khalifa
Abdullahi, a Baggara of the Taaisha tribe from Darfur, took up his
plans. To the children<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_166">[166]</span> of the desert Egypt might well seem an easy
and attractive field for plunder. They had had a rough experience
of the quality of British troops in action, but these new
antagonists had always followed up their victories by retreat and
evacuation. They had no reason to doubt the continuation of the
same nerveless policy. The British Government talked loudly of
abandoning Egypt itself. Any resistance by Egyptian troops
unsupported seemed an absurdity. But unexpected obstacles arose. A
revolt in Darfur, war with Abyssinia, and the opposition of the
great Kabbabish tribe, combined to delay the Khalifa’s advance. Not
until 1889 did he send his best general, Wad el Nejumi, forward.
Nejumi pressed on without misgivings. Only Egyptian troops were
guarding the frontier. But the Egyptian battalions, trained and led
by British officers, were no longer mere droves of frightened
sheep. Under Wodehouse at Argin, and under Grenfell at Toski, they
first checked, and then annihilated, Nejumi’s army. Thenceforward
the dervish power steadily declined. The recapture in 1891 of
Tokar, Osman Digna’s chief base of supplies, put an end to his
influence in the Suakin district. Raiding and frontier warfare
continued till 1896, but there was no serious fighting, until the
Dongola Expedition in 1896 marked the opening of the well-prepared
campaign which ended in the complete overthrow of the Khalifa’s
power.</p>

<p>Once more the day of punishment for the guilty had dawned. In
the disasters and defeats inflicted by the Mahdi, in the horrors of
the sack of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Khartoum and many another town, Egypt had paid the penalty for her
sins against the Soudan. In blood and shame she had reaped a full
harvest. But the unhappy Soudanese had only thrown off the yoke of
one master to find themselves under that of one much more terrible.
Even before the Mahdi’s death plunder and success had corrupted the
new faith, and dimmed the first glow of religious fervour. The
Khalifa, under the guise of religion, had developed into a cruel
and bloodthirsty tyrant. He and his principal supporters, Arabs
from Western Darfur, regarded themselves as conquerors in a foreign
land. Especially since he had brought his own tribe, the Taaisha,
to settle in Omdurman, he had made it his policy to depress the
power of the Nile Valley tribes like the Jaalin and the Danagla. On
them fell the brunt of his military expeditions. Executions,
massacre, and confiscations, were the order of the day. The
inhabitants of whole districts, especially in the once-populous
country along the Blue Nile, were forced to come and live at
Omdurman, which grew into a city of 400,000 inhabitants. This
concentration, by at once creating a great demand and withdrawing
the agricultural population from their proper occupation, produced
the most terrible famines. Everything was sacrificed to the
supremacy of the western Arabs. In ten years more damage was
inflicted upon the country by this pack of human wolves than in all
the sixty years of Egyptian dominion, bad as it was. Slatin Pasha
estimates that 75 per cent. of the population perished. Great as
the abominations of the slave-trade had been before, they were
never greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> than
under the Khalifa’s rule. The export of slaves was forbidden, but
from all parts of the country they were brought in droves to the
market at Omdurman.</p>

<p>The slave-dealing tribes had been the principal instrument of
vengeance upon Egypt. It was now their turn for chastisement. The
Egyptian Sirdar, Sir H. Kitchener, who fought with the railway as
well as with troops, advanced to Dongola in September, 1896, and
the banks of the river were again occupied up to Merowe. Next year
Abu Hamed and Berber were taken, and the new railway laid from Wadi
Halfa across the Korosko desert. Early in 1898 the battle of the
Atbara was won by the Anglo-Egyptian troops. In September the great
battle of the campaign was fought at Kerreri, Omdurman was taken,
and the Egyptian flag was once more flying at Khartoum, this time
with the British flag beside it. By the end of the year the
authority of the new rulers was established, after some difficult
and troublesome campaigning, throughout the Eastern Soudan as far
south as Fazokhl and Famaka; gunboats, though blocked in the Bahr
el Gebel, had proceeded up the Bahr el Ghazal and hoisted the flags
near Meshra el Rek. Before the end of 1899 the Khalifa and the
remnant of his supporters still in the field had fought their last
fight. In the hour of their downfall the dervish chieftains
displayed a splendid courage worthy of their race. Proudly
disdaining to be fugitives in the lands they had ruled, they
perished to a man with their faces to the foe.</p>

<p>But of far greater importance than the final destruction of the
Khalifa were the events that<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_169">[169]</span> followed on the fall of Omdurman, which are
inseparably connected with the name of Fashoda. Since the time when
the Khedive Ismail was pursuing his wild career of annexation
without attracting any particular attention except from the natives
of the countries annexed, the whole position of affairs had
entirely altered. In every direction European Powers had appeared
upon the scene. In the east Massowah had been handed over to the
Italians in 1885, and they had inflicted several severe defeats
upon the dervishes. In 1893 a British Protectorate had been
declared over Uganda and Unyoro, and in 1895 the British flag was
hoisted at Duffile. The Belgians from the Congo Free State had
pressed on to the Nile, and in 1897 an expedition under Chaltin was
successful in taking Rejaf, which had long been the southernmost
dervish post on the river.</p>

<p>Most serious of all was the French movement from the Upper
Ubanghi district of French Congoland into the Bahr el Ghazal
province. The Belgians had already made considerable expeditions in
this quarter, and had penetrated as far north as Hofrat-en-Nahas in
Southern Darfur. In 1894 they made over their claims to the French.
The French Governor of the Upper Ubanghi, M. Liotard, immediately
began to lay his plans with great energy and forethought for the
solid establishment of French power in the Valley of the Nile. At
the end of 1895 he crossed the Congo-Nile watershed, and seized
Tembura on the river Sueh, an affluent of the Bahr el Ghazal. He
also occupied Dem Zubehr, on the Bahr el Homr. Captain Marchand
arrived with reinforcements from France in 1897,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> and after spending some time
in consolidating his position by occupying posts throughout the
country, he set out on the final stage of his journey. After great
difficulties and some fighting with the dervishes, he reached
Fashoda just eight weeks before the fall of Omdurman.</p>

<p>The French preparations had not escaped the attention of those
responsible for Egypt. As far as the Khalifa was concerned, the
advance of the Anglo-British troops might have been delayed for
some time; but in view of the French advance it was absolutely
necessary for Egypt to reassert her rights in the Soudan
emphatically and at once. Immediately after the occupation of
Omdurman Lord Kitchener hastened on to Fashoda, and found Marchand
already there. The situation was grave. For France it was galling
in the extreme to be foiled just in the moment of success, but for
Egypt the question was vital. The stake at issue was not the
possession of a few acres of swamp, but the control of the summer
water-supply. Marchand’s mission was by no means the mere freak of
an adventurous traveller, anxious to hoist his country’s flag. It
was undertaken as part of a policy skilfully planned and
deliberately pursued.</p>

<p>It was no mere coincidence that in the previous year the
Bonchamps Expedition had set out from Abyssinia, and endeavoured,
though vainly, to join hands with Marchand from the east. Firmly
based in the Bahr el Ghazal, masters of the Upper Nile Valley, and
joining hands with Abyssinia, the French would have been in the end
complete masters of the fate of Egypt. If the French
had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span> insisted, there
must have been war. Happily, they gave way, and by the agreement of
1899 withdrew all their posts in the Bahr el Ghazal. The boundary
of the Soudan was fixed along the Nile-Congo watershed.</p>

<p>Thus the Soudan emerged at last, and finally, it may be hoped,
from her ordeal of blood and fire. Her history will be no longer a
record of tyranny, rebellion, war, and famine, but of steady
progress under a just and civilized government. The work of Baker
and Gordon is bearing fruit at last. Great as were the joy and
relief with which the downfall of the dervish tyranny was hailed
throughout the Soudan, it was largely due to faith in the word and
just dealing of Englishmen—a faith that was first established by
them and those who worked with them—that the whole country settled
down so quickly.</p>

<p>Among all the pioneers of good government in the Soudan one name
stands out conspicuously. Most of the ease and success with which
the present government works is due to the realization of the
reforms recommended in Colonel D. H. Stewart’s Report on the
Soudan. The rulers of the Soudan are the first to acknowledge their
obligation to that masterly document, an epitome of keen
observation and practical wisdom. Fortunate is the country that is
served by such men as he. A few months after he had completed his
report he returned with Gordon to Khartoum. He, at least, had no
delusions as to their prospects of success. And yet he went as
cheerfully and lightly as though</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>To die
treacherously murdered on the Nile bank was a sorry fate for such a
man. The road to the Soudan is strewn with the bones of many
victims. But of them all it may be said, and especially of him:
Their work lives after them, and their memory is nobly avenged.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span><a id=
"c16"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br>
<span class="less">THE NEW KHARTOUM</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">No</span> one whose lot it has
been to travel through the night on the plains of a tropical
country can forget the amazing effect produced when the sun, with
one great leap, as it seems, springs clear above the horizon. All
in a moment the world’s face is altered. Its features are the same,
yet utterly changed. The traveller, however hardened, can scarcely
fail to wonder at the transformation. A journey to the Soudan
to-day produces a very similar impression on one whose mind is full
of the memories of the dark past. The din of battle has hardly
ceased to echo, but the transformation is complete.</p>

<p>Even after Egypt, with all its fascinations, rich with the
remains of ages of civilization, full to the brim of questions and
problems deeply interesting to the student of history, archæology,
politics, or economics, the Soudan, with its triple capital,
Khartoum, Omdurman, Halfaya, comes upon you with a freshness and
charm that are indescribable. Travelling by the ordinary methods,
you may go from Alexandria to Khartoum in about six days. It is
well worth while, even for anyone who has been up and down the
whole length of Egypt, to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_174">[174]</span> take the whole journey in one piece. There
is all the excitement of starting for a new country, and at the
same time an opportunity to gather into a focus all the old
impressions. Easily and smoothly you swing through the fertile
cotton-fields of the Delta, and its populous cities and villages,
prosperous but dirty, and at Cairo you settle down into a most
comfortable sleeping-car for the night journey to Luxor.</p>

<p>Early next morning you are in the cane-fields of Upper Egypt,
with the river close on one side and the desert on the other. At
Luxor you must change on to the narrow gauge for Assouan, and there
is time to refresh yourself with bath and breakfast, and to look
across at the Plain of Thebes and the Valley of the Tombs of the
Kings, or to ride a donkey out to Karnak. From Luxor to Assouan it
is hot and dusty enough, and you are glad to rest there for the
night. Next day you embark at Shellal, above the Dam, for Wadi
Halfa, a voyage of some 200 miles. Coming down, the steamers do it
in about twenty-four hours, but upstream it is a leisurely voyage
of three days. There is plenty of time to see the interesting
antiquities of Nubia, and, above all, the famous rock-hewn temple
of Abu Simbel, the colossal statues of which are, perhaps, the most
impressive of all the monuments of Egypt. It is, besides, a most
beautiful reach of the river; the hills come down to the water in
bold and rugged outlines, showing to perfection in the pure, dry,
desert air.</p>

<p>The effect of the Dam is clearly seen as far as Korosko. First
of all, at Shellal the boat is moored amid a grove of palm-trees,
the temples of Philæ<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_175">[175]</span> are knee-deep in water, and the Nubian
villages look quaint enough as they stand on the edge of the
desert, forlornly mourning their strip of cultivated land, most of
which the greedy Reservoir has swallowed up. Probably a great part
of these people will now migrate to Dongola, but the loss of the
land—for which, indeed, compensation has been paid—is really a
small matter to them. Hardly anywhere is an able-bodied male to be
seen; all are away making their living as sailors or servants
elsewhere, leaving the women and old men to keep their homes. These
Nubian boatmen are a most happy and thrifty people, ready to work
all day and dance all night, always to the accompaniment of a
song.</p>

<p>The boundary between Egypt and the Soudan, settled by the
Convention of 1899, runs along the twenty-second parallel; not far
beyond this is the frontier town of Halfa. There is no mistaking
the signs of British rule. The whole place is rigidly clean, an
extraordinary contrast to the filth of the Egyptian villages. The
streets are well laid out and scrupulously swept, and shady avenues
of trees are springing up. But at present Halfa is not particularly
interesting, except as the railway terminus of the Soudan. It is
twenty-eight hours to Khartoum. Nothing can be more comfortable
than the well-appointed sleeping-car train, which runs twice a
week. Starting at eight in the evening, you strike right across the
Nubian Desert, most desolate and forlorn of countries. The very
stations have no names, but are known merely by their numbers.</p>

<p>In the morning you come to Abu Hamed, back<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_176">[176]</span> to the Nile once more. Abu Hamed is just
at the elbow of the river, where it turns to the west for its great
circuit by Merowe and Dongola. Here was the scene of one of the
stiffest fights in the Soudan Campaign, when General Hunter made
his dash from Korti, in 1897, further down the Nile, to seize the
point for which the new railway was making from Wadi Halfa, and
here are the graves of Fitzclarence and Sidney, officers of the
10th Soudanese, who fell in the battle. Around this spot a ghostly
legend hangs. It happened that the other white officers of the
battalion were wounded on the same day, and the black troops
marched back to their bivouac without any of their white leaders. A
black regiment is always accompanied by its women on the march, and
these have high notions of military honour. They would have nothing
to do with men who dared to return alive from the field on which
their officers had fallen. The warriors quailed before their wives,
and serious trouble was brewing, till a black sergeant, who lay
dying of his wounds, solved the difficulty. ‘Tell the women,’ he
said, ‘that enough of us are dead to guard the spirits of the white
men in the other world. I myself will mount the guard.’ There are
innumerable witnesses to testify that he has kept his word. The
lesson was not lost. It was the same battalion which later, at the
Atbara, raced the Camerons for the enemy’s zareba, and, catching
their Colonel as he ran in front of them, bore him heels foremost
right through the camp, securely hedged by a living wall of bodies,
because a second loss like that of Abu Hamed was not to be thought
of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>From here onward
the journey is full of interest. Berber is springing up again from
its ruins; it even boasts two stations, but it has not an
attractive look as a place to live in; there is as yet nothing more
than the mud huts of the country, and it is the hottest place in
the world. Next comes the Atbara River, though not the scene of the
battle, for that was thirty miles upstream; then Shendi, of fiery
memory, but now the Crewe of the Soudan, and finally, late at
night, you step out of the train at Halfaya, the railway terminus.
One glance at the sky will show you that you are really in the
tropics. Canopus is shining fiercely in the east. Right overhead
the giant Orion strides across the vault. Northwards the Great Bear
stands like a huge note of interrogation in the sky, and just over
the opposite horizon the Southern Cross is looming up.</p>

<p>Halfaya stands on the northern bank of the Blue Nile, near its
junction with the White. It is destined to be the workshop and
commercial quarter of the capital. At present the Government
steamboat factories and workshops are still at Omdurman, a legacy
from dervish days. But already the necessary buildings are
springing up, and as trade increases the railway terminus will
attract more and more to its immediate vicinity. The Blue Nile,
just before its junction, divides into two channels, which embrace
the fertile island of Tuti. Opposite Halfaya, and along the
southern bank of the island, the river runs in a glorious sweep due
east and west for two or three miles. Here, facing northwards,
stands Khartoum, with as imposing a situation as any capital could
wish for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>A well-made road
runs all along the river-front, which is being gradually embanked
and walled. Right in the centre rises the white Palace, the
official residence of the Governor-General, a handsome building, on
the site of Gordon’s old palace, set in a lovely garden. On either
side of it stretch a succession of Government offices and the neat
residences of Government officials, to the new, spacious, and
comfortable hotel on the one side and the Gordon College and
British barracks on the other, pleasantly variegated with gardens
and groves of palm-trees, acacias, limes, and bananas. Behind this
Government belt, the town is carefully laid out into wide streets
and squares in two other belts. The second of these contains, or
will contain, houses and shops built by private persons, but of a
good class and on approved plans; the third is open for the
erection of any buildings that the owners choose to construct.
Finally, close to Gordon’s rampart are the Soudanese barracks, and,
right outside, the native villages, laid out in squares allotted to
different tribes, where you may see huts of every shape,
characteristic of many different parts of Africa.</p>

<p>Considering that three years ago Khartoum was nothing more than
a dirty dust-heap, the work that has been accomplished by the Royal
Engineers is truly wonderful. Of course, the city is still in the
hands of the builders; everywhere are gangs of workmen levelling
roads, preparing foundations, making bricks of Nile mud, carrying,
hammering, digging, building. Women, too, are employed. Their
principal duty is bearing water for the lines of young trees that
will one day make each street<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_179">[179]</span> a shady avenue. Already the town is lighted
with lamps far better than many an Egyptian city, and it is hoped
that in a short time a tramway will be in working order.</p>

<p>From November to March the climate is very delightful: it is
hot, of course, at times, but the north wind blows steadily and
coolly practically every day, and sometimes the nights are even
cold. Even if it is hot, there is always the Blue Nile to refresh
the eyes. It is a comfort to find that the Blue Nile is really
blue—as blue as any Italian lake. One is so often told that it is
called blue because of the mud it brings down during the flood—the
mud which causes the ‘red’ water so dear to the Egyptian
cultivator. But anyone who looks at it cannot fail to realize that
its name is derived from its clear and limpid waters, and not from
its muddy flood-time. One of the most charming scenes in Khartoum
is the view of these blue waters seen from the windows of the
Soudan Club through a green maze of palms and lime-trees.</p>

<p>Khartoum, with its bungalows, offices, shops, and banks, is a
civilized town, summoned up out of nothing, as it were, by an
enchanter’s wand. Far different is Omdurman. Here, too, the
engineers have been at work, clearing, demolishing, and cleaning.
Only those who marched in after the battle four years ago and saw
those foul labyrinths of streets can realize how much has been
accomplished. But though purified and greatly shrunk, of course,
within its limits in the Khalifa’s time, Omdurman remains a real
Central African city, with nothing European about it. It was
originally intended to move all the inhabitants over to<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span> Khartoum; but the natural
convenience of its position on the left bank of the river, just at
the junction of the two Niles, makes it impossible to carry out
this intention. Its population is actually increasing at present,
and it seems far better to let natural forces work their way, and
retain it as the native quarter of the capital, distinct from the
seat of government. It possesses, too, a wide sloping foreshore, or
beach, exactly suited to the feluccas which ply upon the river.</p>

<p>This beach is one of the great sights of Omdurman, and a
fascinating spectacle it is. On a busy day it is absolutely crowded
with traders and porters from all parts of the Soudan. It is the
great market-place for gum from Kordofan, feathers from Darfur,
ivory from the Bahr el Ghazal, dhurra from the Blue Nile country,
and everything else that comes in by boat or camel. All day long
the porters go to and fro, carrying their loads and chanting their
monotonous songs, chiefly tall, broad-chested, but spindle-shanked
negroes from the Nile Valley, Dinkas, Shilluks, Bongos, or Bari,
with here and there a short, thick-set, sturdy hillman from
Southern Kordofan or Dar Nuba. Women equally diverse in type sit
sorting the different qualities of gum. Naked children, brown and
black, tumble and chatter in every direction. It is difficult to
drag one’s self away, so strange and novel and varied are the
sights.</p>

<p>But Omdurman has much more to show. First and foremost the
Khalifa’s house, the only two-storied building in the town, and
built of brick. It is occupied now by the British
inspectors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span> Hard by
are the ruins of the Mahdi’s tomb, too solidly built to be entirely
destroyed, but even its partial demolition has been sufficient to
put a complete stop to pilgrimages. In front is the great square in
which the Khalifa used to preach to his assembled dervishes. It is
surrounded by a high wall excellently built, said to be the work of
the German Neufeld. It is witness now of scenes very different from
those of the old fanatical days, so far removed in everything but
time—perhaps the parade of a Soudanese battalion, a football match,
or the arrival of a string of camels laden with gum from El
Obeid.</p>

<p>In the Beit el Amana are some interesting relics of the past.
Here are the brass cannon taken originally by the Mahdi from the
Egyptians, and piles of captured dervish muskets of every shape and
form, swords and caps; and here, too, is the Khalifa’s carriage, a
ramshackle, broken-down old four-wheeled chariot. It is a puzzle
how it ever got to Omdurman. It looks as if it were built for some
quiet old maiden lady in a French provincial town, but it fell on a
strange master in its old age; and Slatin Pasha, now
Inspector-General of the Soudan, had to run as a footman before it.
Close by is the great broad street leading northwards, by which the
British troops marched in on the battle. Every step is reminiscent
of the last evening of days of the dervish tyranny.</p>

<p>But the most fascinating sight of all is the sook, or market.
The mixture of races is amazing. It would take a trained scientist
to catalogue them all. From a camel to a silver bracelet, there is
nothing dear to a native that cannot be bought.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span> Here are made and sold the
angarebs, or native bedsteads, woven with string across a low
four-legged wooden framework. As yet these people have not much
mechanical ingenuity, and their appliances for working in wood and
iron or other metals are rude in the extreme. The past in the
Soudan has not been conducive to the development of the arts, but
there is promise for the future.</p>

<p>One feature of the place is the curiosity shops, full of many
strange spears and shields, knives and sabres, and occasionally an
iron gauntlet or coat of mail such as the dervishes wore; but these
are rare now. These Arab shopmen know how to drive a hard bargain,
and love nothing better than chaffering over a price. All
curiosities are called ‘antiquos.’ There is an annual flower-show
in Khartoum, at which a prize is given for the best ‘antiquos.’ A
Soudanese turned up who was very anxious to compete for this prize
with a live porcupine, which he insisted was an ‘antiquo.’ He was
allowed to exhibit at last, but not for competition, on condition
that he himself led it about by a string, as the authorities could
not undertake its charge. With more justice a live tortoise is also
commonly offered for sale as a very choice ‘antiquo.’ In another
quarter are the rope-makers, twisting their long coils of fibre in
exactly the same way as they have been twisted for centuries;
further on, the basket and net makers are weaving dried reeds in
curious patterns. Yet another part is entirely devoted to the needs
of women. Here are combs and strings of all kinds of beads,
unguents, and the strange preparations they use for fixing the
small plaits in which<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_183">[183]</span> they tie their hair; cinnamon bark and
other scents, without which no wedding is complete; cooking-pots
and other articles of their scanty domestic furniture; even dolls
of most weird and fantastic shapes and material, and many other
quaint trifles. The whole place is crowded with women, black and
brown, many of them tall in stature, easy and graceful in their
movements, and, however ugly they may be in other respects, nearly
all with the most beautifully shaped arms.</p>

<p>It is a strange contrast to go a little further on through the
western outskirts of the town, and to find a game of polo
proceeding on the hard desert sand. And beyond, again, in the
middle of these great spaces, far from the rush and turmoil of the
town, are the quiet graves of two or three of those who have laid
down their lives in this far country, and shall see their homes no
more.</p>

<p>It would take a long time to get tired of merely riding about in
Omdurman and watching the thousand and one sights of such a place,
and reflecting on the stranger scenes that must so frequently have
been enacted there less than five short years ago. But if you want
a gallop in the desert, nothing is more delightful than to pass
along the broad street leading northwards through the deserted
quarters of the once huge city, and to ride, with the keen wind
blowing freshly in your face, to Gebel Surgham, the hill which
overlooks the field of Kerreri, that historic field of bloodshed.
The merest novice can easily follow every phase of the battle, and
see where wave after wave of the dervish hosts rushed madly but
heroically to their doom. Some of their skulls still lie bleaching
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span> the sun. There,
too, is the khor where the Lancers made their famous charge. Or you
may take boat, and sail past the mud forts that saluted the
steamers which came just too late for the watcher anxiously
straining his eyes to see them from the palace in Khartoum. Almost
every spot has its own historic interest. Perhaps as you skim along
before the wind a battered old paddle-steamer labours creaking
past, towing a string of barges. It is one of Gordon’s gunboats,
once more patched up and restored to duty.</p>

<p>But of all the sights and interests of this fascinating place,
by far the most impressive, as in Cairo itself, is the ancient and
mighty river. Khartoum and Omdurman are what they are because here
the two great tributaries join their forces and set out across the
waterless desert on their great mission to Egypt. The spot where
the Blue and White rivers meet, and for some distance flow side by
side unmingled, would be still in many ways the most notable in all
Northern Africa, even if Khartoum and all its eventful history were
blotted out.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Khartoum</span> would be a sad
place to visit if it were nothing more than a city of memories.
Happily, it is no longer so. It has indeed a history behind it,
full of lessons and warnings which cannot be ignored. But the
Khartoum of to-day is looking forwards, and not backwards; it is
the young capital of a young country. It is barely four years since
the final defeat and death of the Khalifa, and it is only from that
date that the establishment of settled government can be
reckoned.</p>

<p>The Sirdar, Sir Reginald Wingate (the post of Governor-General
of the Soudan is still combined with the command of the Egyptian
Army) might well have despaired of the task which confronted him of
administering those vast regions, 1,000,000 square miles in extent,
when he succeeded to his post. The difficulties to be faced were
enormous. It seemed as if every germ of civilization had been
extinguished by the dervish rule. Everywhere villages were
deserted; lands, once fertile, had gone out of cultivation; actual
famine was seriously threatened. The decrease of population was
extraordinary. Whole tribes enumerated in Colonel<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> Stewart’s list had totally
disappeared. When the British troops reached Metemmeh in the final
march to Khartoum, they found the place a shambles. The once
powerful tribe of the Jaalin had been massacred almost to a man by
the Baggara dervishes. That was but one instance out of many of the
Khalifa’s methods of government.</p>

<p>From a country so wasted and desolate it seemed hopeless to
expect a revenue for many years. The fabric of administration had
to be built up again from the very bottom, and there was no money
to do it with, far less to provide for that capital expenditure
always necessary in a new country. Only Suakin, Halfa, and Dongola,
from their longer military occupation, possessed even the rudiments
of the machinery of government. No money was to be expected from
England. More than that, every British officer in the Soudan was
turning longing eyes to the war in South Africa. It was difficult
to get new men with such an attraction elsewhere. Yet in spite of
this it may be fairly said that the Soudan government has come
safely through the troublous period of infancy. Sheer hard work on
wise and statesman-like lines has had its due effect, and the
British officials, most of them soldiers whose abilities would have
brought them to distinction elsewhere could they have been spared,
can so far congratulate themselves on the result of their patient
labours.</p>

<p>Though greatly shrunk within its former limits, the
Anglo-Egyptian Soudan is still of very great extent. On the north
the boundary with Egypt is now the twenty-second parallel,
following this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
line, which passes just north of Wadi Halfa, right across the
desert to the Tripoli border on the west, and to the Red Sea on the
east. It then follows the coast past Suakin as far as a point about
seventy miles south of Tokar, where it meets the Italian colony of
Eritrea. Here, turning inland, it runs south-west, crossing the
river Gash just above Kassala, down to a point on the Setit River,
another tributary of the Atbara. Here Abyssinian territory begins,
and the boundary trends more to the south than before, going by
Gallabat and crossing the upper waters of the Rahad and the Dinder,
tributaries of the Blue Nile, till it reaches the Blue Nile itself
just above Famaka and Fazokhl. Hence it runs right south to the
west of the Beni Shangul hills, across the Baro, Pibor, and Akobo
rivers, all in the Upper Sobat district, till it reaches a point
where the sixth degree of north latitude cuts the thirty-fifth
degree of longitude east of Greenwich. The sixth parallel is
roughly the line of division between the Soudan and the Uganda
Protectorate as far as the Nile, the southernmost Soudanese post on
the Nile being at Mongalla, and the northernmost British at
Gondokoro. On the other side of the Nile the boundary, starting
from Lake Albert, runs north-west for a very long distance along
the Nile-Congo watershed, first along the Congo Free State, then
along French Congoland, till it reaches the borders of Darfur. The
corner, however, between the Nile and this line, as far west as the
thirtieth degree of longitude east, and as far north as a point
nearly opposite Mongalla, is known as the Lado Enclave, and is
still held by the Belgians,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_188">[188]</span> being leased by them during the life of
King Leopold. On reaching Darfur the boundary runs northwards along
the western edge of that country to about the thirteenth parallel,
and thence north-west across the desert to the borders of
Tripoli.</p>

<p>In this vast area, some 1,200 miles in length and 1,000 in
breadth at the broadest part, there is naturally an immense variety
of country. The Northern Soudan is, with the exception of a strip
of land along the Nile, almost a desert; it is, in fact, a lesser
Egypt. Up to Shendi it is a rainless country. From Shendi to
Khartoum, and some way south, there is a regular but not
extraordinary rainfall during the months of July, August, and
September. Further south, about parallel 13°, tropical rains begin,
becoming heavier and longer towards the Abyssinian hills on the one
side and the Upper White Nile and the Bahr el Ghazal on the other.
With the rainfall the character of the country changes. To the west
of the White Nile, between parallels 15° and 11°—that is, nearly as
far south as Fashoda—the country of Kordofan and Darfur stretches
in vast plains or steppes, covered with low thorny trees, mimosa
and gum trees, and prickly-grass. Water is scarce, and stored in
wells and the trunks of baobab-trees. There are occasional hills,
which become greater and more numerous towards the west and the
south. In Southern Kordofan the plains and valleys between the
hills are rich in vegetation and huge trees. They are impassable
during the rains, and also after them, until the long grass has
been cleared by burning.</p>

<p>The Bahr el Ghazal is a real land of waters,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span> the Punjab of the Soudan, for
it has five principal rivers, all affluents of the Bahr el Ghazal.
Part of the country consists of little but the most dismal swamps;
but nearer to the watershed there is much rolling country between
the rivers. The soil is fertile, and there is an abundance of
forests and parklands. To the east, along the course of the Atbara,
and between the Blue and White Niles, there are vast level plains
of alluvial soil, very fertile when flooded or after the rains. The
country gradually rises towards the Abyssinian frontier. At wide
intervals great masses of rock protrude, some consisting of
excellent granite, better than that in the Assouan quarries. As the
country rises it becomes more and more wooded, until there is dense
jungle, especially near the Blue Nile. The scenery all along the
Abyssinian frontier is described as very beautiful and mountainous;
but most of it is very unhealthy, especially during and after the
rains, when the climate is fearfully hot and oppressive, and
malarial fevers of several kinds are common even among the natives
themselves. The country south of the Sobat near the Nile belongs to
the swamp districts. Further inland is the least explored and most
uninhabited part of the Soudan; it is not likely to attract much
attention at present.</p>

<p>The natives of the Soudan fall roughly into two divisions—Arab
and negro. Generally speaking, the Arabs are all north of a line
drawn east and west some distance below Fashoda, the negroes south
of it. But any precise classification of races is impossible. The
Arabs, as a conquering race, imposed their religion and their
language upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
original inhabitants. Many so-called Arab tribes are really almost
negro. The confusion of blood is very great. Slavery has introduced
a very strong negro element into many tribes whose Arabic descent
is unquestioned. Sometimes, when the original race was not negro,
they have preserved their own language. Thus, the people of Dongola
speak a tongue of their own besides Arabic, and several of the
nomad tribes in the Halfa-Suakin district are apparently not Arabic
in descent.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Kordofan afford an example of the mixture of
blood. The sedentary village population consists of the aboriginal
inhabitants, with an admixture from Darfur. Under the Egyptian
conquest a good deal of Turkish and Levantine blood was introduced,
as well as negro blood from the South by means of slavery. The
nomad tribes are a much superior race mentally and physically, and
talk a much purer Arabic. Their great occupations are
cattle-breeding, carried on by the Baggara tribes, and
camel-breeding, carried on by the Kabbabish and the Beni Gerrar.
Besides these there are also the hill tribes, negroes, very black
in colour and small in stature, peaceful by nature, but warlike
when roused by the attacks of the nomad Arabs. Of all the negro
races in the Soudan, these are the most intelligent and
hard-working.</p>

<p>The whole of the Soudan is now directly governed, with the
exception of Darfur, by the Governor-General and his subordinates.
Darfur, though a tributary State, once more enjoys internal
independence under its own Sultan. After the fall of Omdurman Ali
Dinar, a member of the former<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_191">[191]</span> ruling house, then resident in Egypt, was
sent back to Darfur. The people had been for some time uneasy under
the Khalifa’s hand, and he found little difficulty in establishing
his position. His prestige and power were considerably increased in
1902 by the surrender to him of the last remnant of the dervishes,
who had fled westwards from Bor, on the Nile, their last station.
The remainder of the country is divided into provinces, or
mudiriehs, for the purposes of administration. The capital,
Khartoum, with its sister towns and a district within a radius of
ten miles, forms one province by itself. Immediately south of it is
the Ghezireh (the Island), comprising all the rich and fertile
district between the two Niles, formerly known as the island of
Sennar. It is the kernel of the Soudan. South and south-east of the
Ghezireh, stretching along the Abyssinian frontier, and extending
from the White Nile on one side across the Blue Nile to Gallabat
and Gedaref, is the province of Sennar. North of Sennar, along the
upper waters of the Atbara and the boundary of Eritrea is Kassala.
Suakin is the maritime province. Halfa is the northern frontier
district. Dongola and Berber extend along the Nile. Kordofan,
largest of all in extent, occupies all the country west of the
White Nile as far as Darfur. All these make up the Arab and
Mohammedan Soudan. The pagan negro portion is divided into Fashoda
Province, including all the Sobat country, and the Bahr el Ghazal
Province, to the east of the Nile and south of Kordofan.</p>

<p>Each province is ruled by a Governor, or Mudir, a British
officer of the Egyptian Army; under him<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_192">[192]</span> are one or two inspectors, also British
officers, and one or two subinspectors, who are English civilians,
members of the newly-formed Soudan Civil Service. The mudiriehs are
subdivided into mamuriehs, or police districts, presided over by a
mamur, or inferior magistrate; all the mamurs are Egyptian
officers. Each province is, in many respects, a little empire by
itself. Where the distances are so great, there must necessarily be
a great deal of decentralization, and every Governor has a great
deal of independence. But he is, of course, subject to the
authority of the Governor-General, and his expenditure is carefully
controlled by the central Finance Department.</p>

<p>The first duty of the provincial Governors is to maintain peace
within their borders, and to make the inhabitants acknowledge the
authority of the Government. In the elder provinces, Halfa, Suakin,
Dongola, and Berber, there was no difficulty. The nomad tribes, the
only possible source of trouble, are regularly paying the tribute,
which has been imposed on them more as a badge of authority than
for revenue purposes. As long as this is paid and they behave well,
they are left to the rule of their own sheikhs, according to their
custom. At Khartoum the presence of a British battalion insures
order among a people who have not forgotten the sound of bullets.
The stories of mutiny among the black troops were greatly
exaggerated. It lasted only for a day, and was nothing more than a
skirmish between two battalions which had a difference over some
women. On the borders of Darfur there was a slight disturbance, but
Ali Dinar is a strong and capable ruler, who<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_193">[193]</span> understands very well that it is his
interest to be on good terms with the Government, and the matter
has been satisfactorily settled. In South-Western Kordofan the
Nubas in the hills have been accustomed for centuries to raid each
other, and be raided in their turn by the Arabs of the plains. In
such remote regions it is difficult to summarily suppress customs
of this sort, but it is hoped that permanent peace will soon be
established by means of camel-corps patrols. The same applies to
the frontier raids on the Abyssinian side. There was some
reluctance at first to deal drastically with these raiders, for
fear of trouble with Menelik, but now that the boundary has been
definitely settled by the recent agreement, the raiders can be
punished without any question of violating the frontier. In Fashoda
Province the tribes, even the wild and shy Nuers, are settling down
quietly, and though they hate the ‘Turk,’ they are glad to welcome
the British.</p>

<p>The Mek or King of the Shilluks, who live on the banks of the
Nile from Lake No to a point above Fashoda, gave some little
trouble at one time. He was very much struck with the institution
of tax-collectors, which he determined to imitate. Accordingly, he
put some of his people into a kind of uniform, and sent them round
the villages to collect women and corn, nominally for the
authorities of Khartoum. But he was informed that, while the
Government admired his zeal for civilization, they felt, at the
same time, that his knowledge of it was so elementary that it was
necessary for him to devote some time to further study before he
put his theory into practice. He is now undergoing a course of
tuition at Wadi Halfa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>The Bahr el
Ghazal is the most recently occupied province. Posts are now
occupied at Wau, Rumbek, Dem Zubehr, Shambe, Chak Chak, Tonj,
Meshra-el-Rek, and Channamin on the Jur River. The country was
occupied without difficulty. Here the two principal tribes were the
Dinkas in the north and east and the Niam-Niams or Azande in the
south. All the smaller tribes, Jur, Bongo, Golo, etc., had been
broken up by repeated raids, and had fled to one or other of these
powerful neighbours for protection, the protection practically
taking the form of slavery. A tract of 150 miles square had thus
relapsed into absolute wilderness, though once thickly peopled. Now
the tribes from the Dinka side are returning and rebuilding their
villages under British protection, an immense advantage to the
country, for they are hard-working and industrious, while the
Dinkas are lazy and troublesome in civil life, although good
soldiers. Early in 1902 one of the Dinka tribes fell upon a convoy
and murdered a British officer near Rumbek by treachery. But the
murder was speedily avenged, and this was the only instance of
active hostility. The Niam-Niams, although cannibals, are much more
intelligent and progressive. They are very well disposed and
anxious to trade. The worst enemy in the Bahr el Ghazal is not any
human foe, but disease, especially the blackwater fever, which has
been of a severe type, and more than one valuable life has been
sacrificed to it. Fortunately, as experience of the country grows,
the danger diminishes, and it is hoped that as the country is
developed, with better housing and communication, and less moving
about in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span> rains,
still greater improvement may be looked for.</p>

<p>On the whole, the Soudan is far more peaceful internally than it
has ever been before. Nothing has had a more pacifying effect than
the spectacle constantly witnessed of British officials roaming the
country unarmed and unescorted. This visible confidence has done
much more than years of campaigning could ever do. There have been,
it is true, one or two occasions when troops have had to be
employed. The Soudan is still full of combustible materials.
Fanaticism and ignorant superstition combined are dangerous
elements. But the Government has taken to heart the lesson taught
by the rise of the Mahdi. When troops are sent, care is taken that
they shall strike swiftly and effectively. A new Mahdi appears in
the Soudan once or twice a year. Once a woman proclaimed herself,
and gained a considerable following. Sometimes they die away of
themselves, but all require to be carefully watched. Such an one a
few months ago had to be put down by an expedition in Kordofan. His
capture and defeat at once put an end to his divine pretensions.
These petty outbursts are legacies from the unhappy past; under
good government they will become less frequent and less dangerous.
Every day the Pax Britannica grows stronger and more deeply rooted
in every direction. Peace once established, the British officer
finds his real work only begun. The restoration of order was
comparatively simple, the kind of business for which he had been
trained. His regimental duties may have given him some slight
acquaintance with accounts and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_196">[196]</span> book-keeping, or the elements of military
law and procedure. Every scrap of such knowledge must be beaten out
and made to reach as far as possible, and so guide him in his
financial and judicial duties. But where will he have learnt to
make bricks, to measure land, to make roads, to pronounce on
methods of gathering rubber or gum, or the diseases of cattle or
dhurra? Yet all these things he will have to do, and many others in
the course of his busy days. One of the great attractions of the
Soudan is the splendid keenness of all these men, soldiers and
civilians alike. From Wadi Halfa onwards the same spirit is
observable in everyone you meet. Grumbling you will hear, but it is
the grumbling of keen men. The Governor of one province is
convinced that too much is being spent on the capital. If only some
of that money were given to him, he would soon show startling
developments. Another thinks his trade suffers because the railways
or the steamers are not so good as they ought to be. Another is
dissatisfied because he cannot get a schoolmaster sent him, and so
on. All are not, of course, equally competent (that could not be),
but there are no idlers. All are working heartily for the good of
the Soudan and its people, and the honour of their own country.
Many of the Governors and Inspectors of Provinces have fought in
command of the black battalions against the Arabs. They learned to
like the one and to respect the other. The liking and the respect
are repaid tenfold. There could be no better foundation for sound
government, and from Suakin to El Obeid, and from Halfa to
Gondokoro the Englishman is obeyed and trusted as no ruler of the
Soudan has ever been before. It is, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_197">[197]</span> hardly necessary to add that all these
men are young. The Sirdar himself, old in experience, is young in
years, and from him downwards, whether on the civil or the military
side, there is hardly a man over forty. The administration of these
vast regions in a tropical climate is no sinecure. A young country
needs youth and activity in its rulers.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that we have been immensely assisted in
our task by the Egyptians. All the minor administrative posts are
held by them. Most of the clerks in the various Government offices
are Syrians or Copts from Egypt. Without this small fry of
officialdom, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to
carry on at all. Many of these Egyptians have done and are doing
their work faithfully and well, but it has been a hard struggle to
fight against the old Soudan traditions. In former days, when a man
went from Egypt to serve in the Soudan, he expected either to die
or to get rich in a very short time. Death was always before his
eyes, so he made haste to be rich while he could. To the fellah the
Soudan meant nothing less than death; his family mourned him as
lost, and lost he generally was; but the official, if he came back
at all, was set up for life. Of course, any case of taking a bribe
or extortion is severely punished whenever detected; but, in spite
of this, corruption undoubtedly does go on to a certain extent, so
much is it in harmony with the traditions of the official and the
expectations of his victim. Moreover, the Egyptian is not very
capable of enduring a bad climate. He seems to give up<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span> heart immediately. A class of
natives educated enough to take his place in the Government service
is badly required, but does not at present exist.</p>

<p>A great deal is often talked of the evils of military
government, and, of course, there comes a time when military
methods are out of place. But I doubt very much if any set of
civilians could have done so well with a country like the Soudan as
the soldiers have. Whatever may be the soldier’s fault, what he is
told to do, that he will set to work to do, and very likely he will
carry it through successfully, however little training he may have
had, where a cleverer man might be dismayed by difficulties. In
fact, the government is military because it is mainly carried on by
soldiers (there was no one else to do it), but it is run on
civilian lines. Spend a morning in the office of a Mudir or
Governor of a province, and you will go away with an enhanced
opinion of the powers of a British officer.</p>

<p>First of all, you will find him talking fluent, if not always
perfect, Arabic, that most difficult of tongues. An interpreter is
present in case of an emergency, but he is seldom appealed to. In
turn, a bewildering variety of subjects is dealt with. A criminal
trial has to be steered through one of its stages. Next, two sets
of villagers come in with a petition as to a dispute of
land-ownership. In a land which has seen such vicissitudes as the
Soudan, questions of title are numerous and difficult in the
extreme; within the last twenty years the same plot of land may
have had several sets of <em>bonâ fide</em> occupiers, and finally
none. The two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
parties come in scowling fiercely at each other (they have probably
had a fight already on the land in question), and squat down on the
floor, while their spokesmen step forward to tell their tale. The
Mudir is addressed as the Protector of the Poor, the Shield from
Oppression, and a number of other names. When the matter is
disposed of, after a great deal of hard swearing on both sides,
everybody who has anything to do with it attempts to give his
version simultaneously, and finally the whole crowd has to be
thrust out separately by the police, still talking as they go.</p>

<p>Then comes a succession of applicants with other grievances and
petitions—Greeks alleging some breach of contract, Arab land-owners
demanding remission of taxation or loans for a sakieh, or for
sowing seeds. Next the plan of a house has to be examined, the
quality of certain bricks to be looked into, an auction of
river-fisheries to be held, or a contract about a Government ferry
adjusted. Then there are questions concerning drains or wells,
pumps or police, licenses for boats or liquor, and a thousand and
one other questions of administration. Finally, there is
correspondence with headquarters, to adjust some financial, legal,
or educational matter. It is no use being a Mudir, or, indeed, any
other official, under the Soudan Government, unless you are
prepared to work like a horse, and deal fearlessly with nearly
every department of human life.</p>

"c18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<span class="less">JUSTICE AND SLAVERY</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">There</span> is no Magna Charta in
the Soudan. It is expressly laid down in the Anglo-Egyptian
Agreement of 1899 that the country is to be governed under Martial
Law, and all legislative power resides in the Governor-General,
subject to the approval of H.M.’s representative in Egypt. But
Martial Law is a vague and unsatisfactory term. During the recent
operations in the Transvaal a flying column was sent to occupy a
railway terminus and to secure the rolling-stock therein. The
seizure was successfully accomplished, but when the engines were
examined they were all found to be defective in certain essential
parts of the mechanism. The commander of the column sent for the
railway officials and ordered them to restore the missing pieces.
In vain they protested that they knew nothing of them. The soldier,
an Australian, was a man of few words. ‘I shall shoot you in the
morning,’ said he, ‘unless the pieces are found.’ They objected
that such a course was utterly illegal, even under Martial Law. ‘My
view of Martial Law,’ he replied, ‘is that you must do what I tell
you or take the consequences. In any case, discussion is useless.
The shooting-party is ordered at eight.’ The<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_201">[201]</span> engines were complete in every
particular long before the fatal hour; but such methods, though
sometimes necessary in war, are not suitable to peaceful
administration. Martial Law remains a power in the background, but
the Government lost no time in setting up a system of Civil
Justice, and one of its earliest acts was to appoint a properly
qualified Legal Adviser.</p>

<p>It is fortunate that English barristers are accustomed to give
advice on a great variety of matters. The Legal Adviser, especially
at first, when he acted temporarily as Director of Education, had
very multifarious duties. He was at that time the only judge in the
country, and, besides strictly legal matters, had to assist in
drafting regulations relating to customs and commerce, game,
travellers, and many other subjects. But his chief occupation was
the preparation of penal and civil codes. With one exception, which
will presently be noticed, there was no existing foundation to
build upon. Under the old Egyptian rule the criminal law supposed
to be administered was the Khanoon Humayoun, a Turkish code dating
from 1837, but this was perfectly unsuitable for use by a civilized
Power. It was wisely decided to make use of Indian and Colonial
experience. A penal code and code of criminal procedure were
promulgated as soon as possible, founded on the Indian codes,
modified to suit the simpler requirements of the Soudan, and made
to resemble courts-martial in their procedure to facilitate their
working by soldiers. This was followed by a civil ordinance,
likewise adapted from the Indian Civil Procedure Code, as used in
Burma and British Bechuanaland. By the end of 1901 a system
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> civil justice
was at work in all the provinces except Kordofan, Fashoda, and the
Bahr el Ghazal. It has since been extended to Kordofan, and even in
the Bahr el Ghazal and Fashoda a beginning has been made.</p>

<p>In each province the inferior police-court work is done by the
Egyptian mamurs, who exercise summary jurisdiction on a small
scale. All the more important cases are heard by the Mudir,
inspectors and sub-inspectors, who form various courts of differing
strength according to the nature of the trial. Besides the Legal
Adviser there have also been appointed three English judges, all
trained English barristers. Their headquarters are at Khartoum,
where they form the superior court and court of appeal, and they
also travel on circuit in the provinces, either to relieve a
particular pressure of work or to avoid the trouble and expense of
bringing up cases to Khartoum. At present, of course, any very
definite or precise division of duties among the different members
of the judiciary is impossible. The ordinary judicial business has
been immensely added to by the work of Land Commissions, and every
available person has had to be pressed into the service. Naturally,
after twenty years of anarchy, of emigrations and immigrations, and
of general unsettlement, the ownership of the land is a matter of
the greatest possible doubt and confusion, and endless disputes
arise. In the early part of 1903 one of the English judges was
sitting in Dongola Province on a Land Commission. His preliminary
list alone contained 400 cases; and Dongola is by no means the most
contentious province. But this work will now soon be
completed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> and a
more complete organization of the courts will be possible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the criminal law has been very well administered, and,
if the complete inexperience in such matters of the British
officers who have had to act as judges in the provinces is taken
into account, the administration of the civil law has also been
most creditable. Mistakes are made, of course, but substantial
justice has been done. Confidence in the tribunals, as well as the
need for them, is growing rapidly. The fact that the amount of work
done in the civil courts in 1902 was exactly double what it was in
1901 is striking testimony to the growing belief in their
impartiality.</p>

<p>The only department in which the whole system had not to be
built up again from the bottom was the administration of the
Mekhemeh Sharia, the courts dealing with the sacred Mohammedan law.
Just as in our own country the ecclesiastical courts formerly dealt
with all questions relating to wills or marriages according to the
canon law, so these courts administer the sacred law in all matters
relating to succession, marriage, personal status, and charitable
endowments. Once they covered the whole field, but as the sacred
law was unchanging, or nearly so, other codes had to be introduced
to suit changing conditions, and their action was gradually
restricted to the subjects mentioned. In the old Soudan nearly
every place of any pretensions had one of these courts presided
over by a Cadi, and they doubtless dealt with many matters outside
the limit, for civil cases could be tried by the Cadi, if both
parties were agreed. The Cadi was frequently paid a very small
salary, or none at all, and was expected<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_204">[204]</span> to make his living out of court-fees and
the presents he received, a system by no means conducive to strict
justice. Now these courts are much fewer in number than formerly,
but each Cadi receives a regular salary, and all the fees go to the
Government. All the Cadis are under the direct supervision of the
Grand Cadi or Cadi of Cadis, assisted by a Mohammedan inspector. It
was very difficult at first to find properly qualified occupants
for these posts. Among native-born Soudanese there were practically
none, and the supply had to come from Egypt. If they were honest,
it was at any rate something to be thankful for. But in days to
come, especially when the Training College at Khartoum has been
more developed, it may be hoped that they will be not only honest,
but also capable, and that they will also possess a sound knowledge
of the law which they have to administer. It is worthy of note that
a Soudanese Cadi has been appointed at El Obeid.</p>

<p>The sacred Mohammedan law is a very delicate matter for
Europeans to deal with. It abounds in defects, but suggestions for
reform coming from a Christian would not be well received. There
are also opportunities for conflict with the ordinary civil courts.
For example, in a question of inheritance a dispute as to whether
the deceased person was a Mohammedan or not could only be properly
settled by the civil court. But all difficulties have been avoided
up to now by tact shown on both sides. The Grand Cadi is a man of
singular enlightenment and ability, and is working hard to improve
the administration of the Mohammedan courts. His remarks on the
general situation, as quoted in Lord Cromer’s Report for 1902, are
worth repeating:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>‘What consoles
me with regard to the stagnant state of the Mohammedan law in this
country is the fact—deplorable though that fact be—that this state
of stagnation is general throughout the Mohammedan world. And,
although, for many centuries, it has been the only law applied to
the people, time has, on account of the failure of those in charge
to administer it properly, necessitated the introduction of other
codes.</p>

<p>‘The whole responsibility for this decline in the Mohammedan law
must be attributed to the authorities of former times.</p>

<p>‘What renders this condition of things the more regrettable is
the fact that some of the causes which have for long been
undermining the stability of this law have become a part of its
traditions, any digression from which would be considered as a
deviation from the Sharia law. Hence, it is impossible for me to
exaggerate the difficulties which obstruct the way of the reformer.
Yet I hope that we may have a good opportunity in this country to
improve this state of things, and to bring about an unprecedented
epoch of advance in the history of reform.’</p>
</div>

<p>Apart from the defects of the religious law, there are many
obstacles to a proper administration of justice in the Soudan.
Justice is a new idea. Colloquial Soudan-Arabic has no very
extended vocabulary. A British officer learning Arabic at Khartoum
had impressed upon his teacher that he only wished to master the
ordinary language of the country. One day a new word turned up. ‘Is
that a good word?’ he asked his teacher. ‘Good?’ said the learned
man. ‘I should think so, indeed. Why, if you use that word, you and
I will be the only people in the Soudan who understand what you
mean.’ The word might well have been the ordinary Arabic term for
justice. There has seldom been any use for it until now in common
parlance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span> To the
mind of the Arab the notion of an impartial tribunal giving final
decisions is an absolute novelty. His natural view is that the
judge decides either according to his own caprice, or according to
the greater bribe, or to please some great man. The image of blind
Justice holding equal scales is very puzzling to him. A judge,
therefore, who, when he has decided a case, thinks he has heard the
last of it, is liable to rude disappointment. The unsuccessful
suitor is very likely to reappear a month or two later and ask for
at least a modification of the judgment. He knows now that a bribe
is worse than useless; so he comes with a terrible tale of ruin and
despair to move the compassion of the Father of the Oppressed and
the Protector of the Poor; or—for he is full of resources—he
alleges that the judgment has not been properly carried out; or
that at the trial an important witness on his side was absent; or
that some third party, who had an interest in the case, never heard
anything about the trial at all. It may be all pure invention, and
very often is, for the Arab can be a fertile liar—that difficulty
is not peculiar to the Soudan—but part of it may be true, and has
to be sifted. It is very probable that some interested party will
not know the date of a trial, when distances are so great and
publication impossible other than by word of mouth, in view of the
universal illiteracy. So the decided case has to be gone into once
more. In the present stage of civilization it is often better to
use the wisdom of Solomon than the wisdom of the code, and justice
must necessarily be more or less patriarchal, for it is of far more
importance to gain the confidence of the people than to abide by
the strict laws of procedure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>So, too, in
administering the criminal law the magistrate finds himself
sometimes confronted by difficulties which could never be
contemplated by any legal code. Alike in the Mohammedan and the
Pagan Soudan ancient beliefs and superstitions live on, fostered to
an incredible extent by the backward state of the people and the
prevailing ignorance. In the face of the habits of mind produced by
these conditions the principles of jurisprudence lose their
significance. The ordinary rules cannot be justly applied to such
cases. Not long ago a native of Southern Sennar was brought to
trial on a charge of murder. There was no dispute as to the facts.
The victim had been savagely done to death in cold blood. The
accused admitted the deed, but pleaded, in all good faith, a
defence which seemed perfectly natural and satisfactory to himself
and every other native. His brother had recently died, and he had
ascertained that his death was due to the evil eye. In accordance
with the moral code of the district, it became his duty towards his
brother to exact vengeance, and he therefore killed the man whose
evil eye had caused the mischief. In his view and that of all his
neighbours there was no more criminal intent in the act than if he
had killed a poisonous snake.</p>

<p>Another most interesting case is related by the Legal Adviser as
having recently occurred in Dongola Province. Taha Ali and Ahmed
Hamad carried on business in partnership as butchers, and Taha kept
the purse. One day Taha told his partner that ten and a half
dollars belonging to the partnership had been stolen. But Ahmed did
not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span> believe him,
and roundly accused him of stealing the money himself. A violent
dispute arose, but at last they agreed to refer the matter to a
holy man then residing in the neighbourhood. This holy man was a
fakir belonging to Timbuctoo, who had made the pilgrimage to Mecca,
and was now returning. At first he was very reluctant to interfere;
it was no business of his, he said; they should go before the
mamur. But the more he refused the more eagerly they insisted. They
even said that if he would not, it was because he could not. It was
a poor sort of fakir that could not find out a little thing like
that, and they would lose no time in proclaiming the fact. At last
he consented to act. First he copied out some passages from some
religious books which he had with him on a native writing-board
with European copying-ink. Then he washed off the writing into a
bowl with bread and water, and divided the bread and water between
the two, telling them that the one in the wrong would shortly
become very ill. Each man consumed his portion of the mess and went
away. An hour or two later Taha Ali was seized with violent pains
in the stomach, and, returning to the fakir, confessed that it was
he who had stolen the money. But in spite of his confession the
pains grew worse, and he died the same day. The authorities stepped
in, and the fakir was put on his trial for poisoning. The facts of
the case were undisputed, and the fakir himself gave evidence on
his own behalf. He pointed out that he had only undertaken to
investigate the affair very reluctantly, as he was well aware that
it was not his business, but he could not damage his reputation as
a holy man. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
adopted the best method of discovering the truth. The man’s death
was the act of God, not his. As for the suggestion that the
copying-ink was poisonous, he was willing on the spot to drink up
the remainder of it, the bottle being still about half full. The
medical examination revealed no sign of poisoning, and the case was
referred to Khartoum.</p>

<p>With the view of discovering the drift of the best native
opinion on these subjects, the Legal Adviser told the story to two
natives, one a religious sheikh of very high position, universally
respected, and the other a servant who had been for many years in
the employment of English masters. The sheikh, whilst not doubting
that such an ordeal, if employed by a man of holy life, was a
reasonable method of detecting crime, was inclined to think that
this particular fakir was an impostor. At the same time, he did not
consider that he should be punished, as the death might be due to
some cause hitherto undiscovered. To illustrate his point he
repeated a well-known story of a man who died at his friend’s house
immediately after eating some honey. Great suspicion fell upon the
friend, who only escaped punishment by the discovery of a dead
serpent coiled up at the bottom of the pot. In this case, too, he
suggested, a snake might have spat into the inkpot. The servant
went further. He, too, was of opinion that trial by ordeal was a
reasonable method of detecting crime, and more than that, it was
really the only satisfactory and effective way, far better than any
investigation by the best and wisest of mamurs. The only thing that
surprised him in the story was that the guilty man should have died
after confessing his crime; for this was contrary to
precedent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span> He could
only conclude that the man was exceptionally wicked, and that God
had taken this opportunity to punish him for other crimes.</p>

<p>In such an atmosphere it is no wonder that miracles abound and
holy men thrive. It is exceedingly difficult to know how to deal
with them. Like the magicians of Ancient Egypt, whose descendants
they are, they are sometimes open to the suspicion of establishing
their miraculous reputation by natural but very undesirable
methods. At Berber the Mudir was anxious to embellish the place
with avenues of trees. So he imported some libbek acacias from
Egypt, and to insure their being watered announced that rewards
would be given to anyone in front of whose house a libbek was
planted as soon as it attained a certain size. For a time all went
well, and the trees grew and flourished. But then a local fakir saw
his chance. He proclaimed that watering trees was contrary to the
will of God, and threatened the most terrible penalties on anyone
who dared to disregard his orders. Only one man, a sergeant in a
black regiment, was bold enough to flout the fakir, and to continue
watering his tree. Within a short time the man himself, his wife,
and his servant, were all dead. It may have been a coincidence; it
may have been the effect of imagination acting on uncultured minds;
but far more probably, though it could not be proved, it was due to
some wicked contrivance of the holy man. In the case of the Dongola
fakir, a very practical solution of the difficulty was adopted. He
was not punished, but facilities were given for his return to
Timbuctoo. Guilty or not, a man whose reputation requires such
bolstering up is a very undesirable resident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>That the various
judges and magistrates administer the law intelligently and with
discretion, and that the people themselves are more and more
contented with the law, and accept it even when it comes in
conflict with old-established ideas, is shown by the decrease in
the number of petitions to the Governor-General. In the Soudan, as
in other Oriental countries, anybody who has a grievance is allowed
to appeal directly to the highest authority, and as the
Governor-General does a great deal of travelling every year, there
is every facility for presenting them. At first they numbered
several thousands every year, but in 1902 they sank to the
comparatively small total of 600. But whilst every endeavour is
made to govern the country on lines acceptable to and understood by
the people, there are, of course, some points on which the policy
of a civilized government is necessarily in opposition to very
deep-rooted customs and habits to such a degree as to completely
upset the old basis of social life. In a minor degree this is true
of the partial application of the game laws to natives, but of far
greater importance is our attitude towards the institution of
slavery and the slave-trade.</p>

<p>The occupation of the Soudan has been a tremendous blow to
slavery; one of the principal recruiting-grounds for slaves has
practically been closed. A certain amount of slave-raiding goes on
along the Abyssinian frontier. Descents are periodically made by
parties one to two hundred strong, well armed, from the
south-western districts of Abyssinia. They raid the Barun negroes,
and carry off the women and children. The same kind of thing is apt
to happen on the Darfur frontier,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_212">[212]</span> and some of the remote tribes in the same
quarter sometimes raid each other with the object of getting
slaves. Some of these, but not many, find their way to Dongola, or
the Ghezireh; others are taken to Tripoli. Special steps have now
been taken by the Anti-Slavery Department of the Egyptian
Government, which now has its headquarters at Khartoum, to put down
this traffic. Two extra English inspectors have been posted, one at
Rosaires, on the Blue Nile, the other at El Obeid. They are to form
small mounted corps of the best Arabs and patrol the disturbed
districts.</p>

<p>Apart from the actual work done, it will be a great thing to
enlist the best of the Arab tribesmen in the Government service,
and it is hoped that they will in time form the nucleus of an
effective native police. These men have been in the past some of
the principal exponents of slave-catching themselves; they ought to
be very adept at their new business. With these exceptions the
slave-trade within the borders of the Soudan has practically
disappeared. During the first year or two captures were
occasionally made of small caravans, but very heavy penalties were
imposed. There is still a constant demand for slaves in Arabia, and
once a slave is shipped over the Red Sea a good profit is assured.
But it is too dangerous now for anyone to try to make a regular
livelihood by it. There are still, however, about twenty cases a
year of trials for offences against the slavery laws, mostly
isolated cases of kidnapping a woman or a child, and probably there
is besides a fair proportion of undetected cases. But the regular
trade is pretty well stamped out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>The benefits of
the abolition of slave-raiding and kidnapping are immediate and
obvious to everyone. Even the Arab can understand them, but he
finds it very difficult to appreciate our attitude—which, needless
to say, is uncompromising enough—towards slavery as a domestic
institution. It is the one serious complaint which he has against
the new government. His domestic habits and customs have been
completely based on slavery for centuries. Slavery is permitted and
recognised by the Koran. In most cases the slaves themselves have
been treated more like members of the family than as slaves, and no
doubt many of them have had far happier lives than they would have
had in their own villages. Nor is it difficult to point to evils
which have arisen from the emancipation of the slaves. It is a
melancholy fact that many of the towns in the Soudan are crowded
with freed slaves, too lazy to do anything but steal, while the
women have recourse to an even less reputable occupation. It is
easier to break down the social system of centuries than to build
up a sounder fabric in its place. But the thing had absolutely to
be done if the Soudan was to have a real regeneration. Even when
the slaves have been well treated, the demoralization caused by
slavery has been great. The Arabs have all the vices of a
slave-owning people. It was a good time to make an absolutely fresh
start. All changes of such magnitude are bound to produce
dislocations. The evils of the change will die out with the present
generation. The good must be waited for patiently, but it is sure
to come.</p>

"c19"></a>CHAPTER XIX<br>
<span class="less">EDUCATION AND THE GORDON COLLEGE</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Probably</span> the last thing
that a military government might be expected to take an interest in
is education, and yet few educational establishments are so widely
famous as the Gordon College at Khartoum. As yet it owes its
reputation to the fact that it was founded by one great soldier in
memory of another, not to its achievements; it was born great. But
already it has justified its founders; its mere existence marks an
extraordinary contrast between the character of the present régime
in the Soudan and that of any preceding.</p>

<p>Whenever the Soudan is mentioned, the first question asked is,
‘How is the Gordon College getting on?’ and the question cannot be
answered in a word. The actual building is indeed for the present
complete. It is a handsome structure of native red brick, built in
the Moorish style, but retaining the collegiate character. It
occupies two sides of a square, the front facing on the river. In
the centre is the principal entrance, and over it a tower. If the
original design is finally carried out, the whole quadrangle will
be completed. Along the inside runs a cool and airy cloister, with
winding stairs leading to the upper story; the class-rooms are
spaciously designed. Its commanding<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_215">[215]</span> position at the east end of the town makes
it a conspicuous landmark for many miles round. From no point is
this so remarkable as from the hill of Surgham, which overlooks the
battlefield of Kerreri. Here is summed up much of the past and the
future of the Soudan. On the one hand is the scene of the final
overthrow of the forces of darkness and ignorance by war; on the
other the symbols of that longer contest for the conquest of the
Soudan by the peaceful arts of science and learning.</p>

<p>With the eye of faith it is easy to look forward into the
future, and to imagine the time, generations hence, when the Gordon
College will be a true centre of learning for all these vast
territories. Then it will stand, a completed quadrangle, in the
middle of large gardens, its own territory, as green and cultivated
as they are now arid and dusty. Its halls and class-rooms will be
crowded with picked students from all the provincial centres, not
vainly pursuing a dry and vain scholasticism, as in the other
degenerate Universities of the Mohammedan East, but eagerly
following in the paths of living science, and learning by practical
teaching in the laboratory and workshop to wrest from Nature her
secrets, and to absorb the principles underlying practice in the
departments of chemistry and medicine, mechanics, agriculture, and
the arts. Perhaps once more, in years to come, the culture and
science of the Arabs will be as famous as they were in the great
days of Arab dominion.</p>

<p>It is a long way to travel from such stimulating forecasts to
the actual state of learning and education in the Soudan to-day.
There was not much learning under the Egyptians, but at least a
certain amount of theological study went on. Under the Khalifa
even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span> that was
sedulously discouraged, and the books were ordered to be destroyed
because he feared that they might tend to discredit the unorthodox
doctrine of Mahdism. Reading and writing were not likely to
flourish under a ruler who, possessing neither of these arts
himself, and entertaining strong suspicions of those who did, was
wont to give drastic expression to his views. As a consequence,
there never was a country more absolutely and wholly illiterate.
Writing is practically an unknown art, and reading hardly less so.
It is perfectly useless to post a Government Proclamation unless a
competent person is stationed by it to read it out to any
passer-by. At the same time, there flourishes the most exaggerated
respect for a written document, which is regarded as a kind of
magic book, and cases have been known in which swindlers have
extorted large sums of money by going round exhibiting a paper
professing to be an order to pay issued by the Government.
Obviously, education has had to be on very humble lines at first,
and must continue so for some time.</p>

<p>Was, then, the Gordon College a too ambitious attempt to
anticipate the future? Is it a mere white elephant, doomed to be a
vain monument of an ill-directed wave of enthusiasm? Such a view is
far from the truth. It would be strange indeed if a project so dear
to the heart of Lord Kitchener was of such a nature. Certainly, it
is impossible to start a complete University right away with a
building and an endowment of some £4,000 a year. Time is of the
essence of the question. It is possible to argue that the money
used in the building might have been more advantageously expended
in other ways. But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
apart from the fact that the subscribers doubtless wished to see
some immediate result for their munificence, I am sure that it was
the right policy to build at once.</p>

<p>For the Gordon College, though not yet a University, is much
more than a college. It is the centre of all the new educational
and intellectual influences in the Soudan. Its director is also
head of the Education Department; the activities of both are
inseparably connected. It acts as an extraordinary stimulus upon
the authorities in the direction of education. It would have been
so easy and so natural for a Government so hard beset for money to
neglect education for other objects, apparently more practical and
more immediately pressing. The actual material presence of the
college makes it impossible for its claims to be overlooked. Very
likely without it there would not have been an Education Department
at all. Secondly, but for the existence of the building, the Soudan
would certainly never have obtained such valuable gifts as those of
Mr. Wellcome’s bacteriological laboratory and Sir W. Mather’s
complete technical workshop apparatus, containing all that is
necessary for the establishment and organization of departments for
manual training and technical instruction. Thirdly, the building
itself has been already, and will be to an increasing extent, of
the greatest use; and, moreover, there is still about £100,000 of
the original endowment remaining, the income from which is playing
a great part, as will be shown, in providing the beginnings of
education in the Soudan, and so laying the foundations for the
future work of the college itself. Lord Kitchener was wiser than
his critics. Among his many claims to fame, none is greater
than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span> the clearness
with which he saw that a sound educational system is one of the
fundamental requirements of the Soudan, as well as a substantial
foundation for our rule.</p>

<p>In 1901 the Soudan Government spent £1,421 on education, in
addition to the Gordon College endowment; in 1902, £3,577; and in
1903 something over £6,000. With such resources as these, it is
obvious that nothing heroic could be attempted. Only the more
immediate needs could be attended to. Looking to the necessity for
the education of a class of native public servants, it was most
important to establish some sound primary schools, in which the
boys should be given a fair general education in reading, writing,
and arithmetic, besides a certain amount of history and geography
and English. Four of these schools are now in existence; two of
them, those at Halfa and Suakin, were established some eight or
nine years ago by the Egyptian Government, and have only recently
been handed over to the Soudan; they are in an efficient condition.
The most interesting, considering their recent establishment, are
those at Khartoum and Omdurman. That at Omdurman was the first, the
direct offspring of the Gordon College. It now numbers over 200
pupils, and is in a most flourishing condition. There are constant
applications for admission, partly, no doubt, from the reason that
pupils of the school are thought likely to obtain Government
employment, but partly also from a real appreciation of the
advantages of education.</p>

<p>The school course is divided into four years, and the curriculum
is based on the Egyptian one—modified to the extent that no
subjects are taught in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_219">[219]</span> English, except English itself. An
inspection of the school made it clear to me that, at any rate, in
the subject which I could understand—the teaching of English—the
methods were thoroughly sound, and the results good. Pupils in
their last year are also taught land-measuring. The reason is the
great demand which comes from every province for land-measurers—a
most important thing in view of the assessments for the
land-tax—while no trained men are available. This part of the work
is taught both in the class-room and practically in the field. I am
certain that in a very short time there will be land-measurers
available of very good ability, so excellent was the quality of
some of the work done.</p>

<p>Some, of course, of these boys are the sons of Egyptians in the
Government service, to whom it is a great blessing to be able to
get a good education for their children on the spot. But far the
majority of them—at least 90 per cent.—are genuine Soudanese, some
of them members of good Arab families, whose fathers were prominent
in the service of the Khalifa. Originally it was intended that this
school should be transferred to Khartoum, and housed in the college
as soon as the general exodus took place. But as Omdurman shows no
signs at present of diminishing, and is, indeed, once more
increasing, the school has been kept on, and another started on
similar lines in Khartoum itself. This school is also flourishing,
but it naturally contains a larger proportion of the Egyptian-born
pupils; altogether it has about 120 scholars. This school is now
housed in the Gordon College itself.</p>

<p>Book-learning is not the only channel of instruction employed. I
had the good fortune to be umpire in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_220">[220]</span> the first football match between Khartoum
and Omdurman schools, in the mosque square at Khartoum. It was a
hot afternoon, and I felt as though I should get a sunstroke whilst
umpiring; but these boys, all hatless as they were, played with
great energy, and appeared to derive nothing but benefit from the
heat. They played a good game, and it was pleasant to see that what
they lacked in experience they made up in courage and
determination. All the players, of whatever shade of black or
brown, and the shades were very various, showed a spirit which
augurs well for the future. Anybody who can play football with
energy in Central Africa must have good stuff in him. The match was
drawn.</p>

<p>In another direction also an encouraging start has been made.
There is at present in the Soudan no skilled native labour;
blacksmiths, tinsmiths, carpenters, and bricklayers, are all in
demand, and have to be imported from outside at great trouble and
expense. In the hope of meeting this demand, an industrial school
has been established at the Dockyard Works, which are now on the
river at Omdurman, but which will eventually be moved to Halfaya.
The head of the Steamboat Department agreed to take in sixty boys
as apprentices. These are divided into two shifts of thirty each,
and they alternately receive a day’s schooling and do a day’s
practical work at their separate trades as carpenters, fitters, or
riveters. In school their time is divided between reading, writing,
and arithmetic, and also drawing. The plan has been found to answer
admirably. Not only does the education they receive improve their
intelligence as workers, but some of the boys have shown such
proficiency in drawing that they are able<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_221">[221]</span> to copy engineering and building designs
with such accuracy as to be able to relieve the English
superintendents of a good deal of work. Many of these boys are sons
of men employed in unskilled labour at the works, who take the
greatest interest in seeing their sons advance so far beyond
themselves. Many applications for admission have to be refused, and
there is little doubt that when Sir W. Mather’s technical school at
the Gordon College is in full swing, it will fill a great need in
the requirements of the country.</p>

<p>On the whole, the most difficult task which the Director of
Education has to face is that of diffusing the elements of
knowledge among the masses of the people. The great distances to be
covered alone impose a tremendous obstacle. But it is extremely
important that at least a portion of the population should be able
to understand the outlines of the machinery of government as laid
down in notices and proclamations, so as to be able to protect
themselves against the exactions of minor officials and the frauds
and deceits practised on them by wandering rogues. It has wisely
been determined to proceed along the lines laid down by Mohammedan
tradition. The kuttabs, or preliminary schools, are a well-known
part of the ordinary religious organization. They are supposed to
give instruction in reading and writing and the Koran, and there
are many of them scattered over the Soudan, as in other Mohammedan
countries. They are, in fact, a sort of private elementary school,
something like the old dames’ schools once existing in parts of
England. Unfortunately, they are almost entirely useless at
present. The teachers are incredibly ignorant. What
little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span> instruction
they give is confined to teaching by rote certain passages from the
Koran, the meaning of which is understood by neither pupil nor
teacher. The buildings are usually filthy to the last degree. The
idea is to establish model kuttabs in different parts of the
Soudan, and to make them as efficient as possible, so as to improve
the others by their example. To quote the words of the
Director:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>‘The process of formation has been in all cases the same. With
the help of the Mudir, a suitable building is put up; then the
least incompetent sheikh that can be procured is installed. After
confidence has been established, and the nucleus of a school
formed, he is superseded by a trained teacher from Egypt, who,
under the local supervision of the Mudir and occasional supervision
from my office, begins to reduce chaos to order.’</p>
</div>

<p>Progress has not been very rapid. Lack of money and lack of
competent schoolmasters sadly hamper all operations. But kuttabs
are now established, attached as a sort of junior class to the
schools at Khartoum, Omdurman, Halfa, and Suakin. A model kuttab
has been established at Berber, which is reported to be doing well,
and another is being built at Dongola. The like is also being
attempted at Wad Medani, a populous town on the Blue Nile, capital
of the province of Sennar, with about 40,000 inhabitants. Reference
has been made to the lack of trained schoolmasters. Egypt itself
feels this difficulty, and Egypt is at present the only source of
supply on which the Soudan can draw. It was to meet this demand—at
least, so far as the kuttabs are concerned—that a small training
college for native sheikhs was opened in the beginning of 1901 in
connection with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span> the
school at Omdurman. At first this interesting experiment was not
very successful. The students, who all belonged to the best Arab
families, were all proud, ignorant, and lazy; and as Arabs they
were inclined to despise the Egyptian schoolmasters, whose task it
was to teach them. But now there is a great improvement. They have
increased in number to about thirty, and only lack of room prevents
a further increase. I watched them doing their own lessons, and
also receiving practical instruction in teaching by taking a class
of the school under the guidance of a master. It was impossible to
doubt the value of the experiments. They were nearly all
fine-looking, intelligent young men, some of them really handsome,
with the keen, clear-cut features that mark the pure-bred Arab.
Three of them had come from distant Kassala, where at present there
are no means of education whatever. The course lasts three years.
At the end of it they are to be examined as to their fitness, and
they will then be drafted off either to teach in their kuttabs or
else to some posts in connection with the native Courts. Whether as
schoolmasters or Cadis, they will be most useful elements in the
development of the Soudan.</p>

<p>In the negro portion of the Soudan, inhabited by the pagan
tribes, the people are so backward in civilization that the
question of education does not at present arise, or, if it does
arise, assumes a totally different aspect. Here is the field for
the missionary. Two missions are already established—one, the
American Medical Mission, on the Sobat; and the other, the Austrian
Roman Catholic Mission at Taufikieh, on the White Nile. Both are
doing good work, and both are to be encouraged and assisted
by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span> the Government.
In other parts of the Soudan it must be remembered that we are
dealing with a fanatically Mohammedan population, and any suspicion
that the Government was trying to proselytize would immediately
wreck all schemes of education, and probably be the signal for
grave disorders.</p>

<p>It will be a long time before the schools turn out sufficient
pupils to fill the Government Civil Service, and there does not
seem to be any danger of producing mere ‘babus,’ hanging about and
relying on a certain knowledge of English to procure them a job.
The teaching of English is entirely confined to those boys who are
going to make use of it in the Government Service or in commercial
pursuits, where its knowledge is required. For the ordinary mass of
the population nothing is to be gained by an imperfect knowledge of
English. The authorities are unquestionably right in discouraging
such teaching; the supposed political advantages of it are small,
if not entirely imaginary. The Soudan can never be a real white
man’s country; its rulers must always be speakers of Arabic, and
its people will do far better to employ their time in more useful
ways than struggling with a foreign language.</p>

<p>The Gordon College is the centre of education, but even now its
activities are not confined to mere teaching. It is proposed to
form a collection of books dealing with the Soudan, its peoples,
its natural history, and its various productions, accompanied by
specimens to illustrate them, and some progress has been made. Mr.
Wellcome’s valuable bacteriological research laboratory is in full
working order, and a skilled expert from Scotland has been in
charge of it for some months. He is doing<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_225">[225]</span> a work of great importance, not only to the
Soudan, but also to the scientific world in general. The Soudan is
a land where strange diseases both of men and animals abound. There
is a wide field for research. The scientific and systematic
examination of these obscure subjects is already bearing fruit, and
cannot fail to ameliorate the conditions of life in these tropical
regions for the European as well as for the native.</p>

<p>Lord Cromer has promised that more shall be done for education
in the future. There is no need for hurry; indeed, it is essential
that the educational system shall be built up slowly with caution
and patience. But in time each province will have its own primary
and technical schools, whose pupils will be selected from the
elementary kuttabs. Afterwards, when all this has been carefully
organized, the provincial schools will in their turn pass on their
more promising students to Khartoum to receive the higher education
which will then be demanded. Then the Gordon College will at last
become a real college. In it the germ of a most hopeful future is
contained. If the work proceeds on the same sound lines as
hitherto—which there is no reason to doubt—great days are coming.
The Arab is capable of a very high degree of civilization, and has
a great intelligence, which has as yet had no chance of
development. And in those days, I doubt not, those who founded the
Gordon College, and first kindled the fire of learning, will be
praised by its students as sincerely and as deservedly as the
benefactors of any of our own Western foundations.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span><a id=
"c20"></a>CHAPTER XX<br>
<span class="less">TRADE AND COMMERCE</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Sir Rudolf von Slatin</span>,
Inspector-General of the Soudan, who possesses an unrivalled
experience of the country, reports that ‘the whole situation in the
country is very satisfactory. Everywhere I went, from north to
south and from east to west, I found that villages and cultivation
had increased. The population is larger and wealthier; flocks and
herds are more numerous; security prevails, and general
satisfaction is expressed with the present rule.’ Once more, or,
rather, nearly for the first time, life and property are safe.
Relieved from the scourge of war and tyranny, people are everywhere
resuming their old occupations. They have even recovered from the
shock of finding themselves under just and settled government, and
are no longer content merely to exist. New wants are being felt,
and with the advance of material prosperity trade and commerce are
springing up.</p>

<p>There are, however, considerable obstacles to the development of
trade. First of all there is a lack of labour. Partly this is due
to lack of population, but partly also to other causes. Slavery has
left its mark, and many of the Arabs are too proud and too lazy to
take part in manual labour; in laziness,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_227">[227]</span> though not in pride, many of the negro
tribes are fully their equals. Secondly, there is the difficulty of
communications in so vast a country, and the lack of transport.
Thirdly, the Soudan is very poor, and capital is wanting. Still,
every year shows an improvement in these respects.</p>

<p>The population is steadily growing, partly by natural increase,
and partly by immigration from neighbouring countries of people who
had fled during the rebellion. Attempts have also been made to
assist the increase by colonization. A number of old soldiers from
the Soudanese battalions, who are enlisted for life, were permitted
to retire, and with their wives and children were established in
villages on the Nile and at Kassala. The villages were organized on
a more or less military basis, with a well-known non-commissioned
officer as chief. Each colonist was allotted two or three acres of
good rain or pasture land, or an acre of Nile foreshore. He was
given grain for sowing, besides a quantity of dhurra sufficient to
support him until his crops grew. Markets were also started.
Unfortunately, the experiments were generally unsuccessful. The
colonies at Dongola and Berber failed altogether. It was found that
the black when released from the strict discipline of the regiment
was more anxious to enjoy doing nothing, after the manner of his
ancestors, than to work, and if he saw a chance of living by
begging or stealing he was apt to leave his cultivation alone, and
go off to some town.</p>

<p>At Hellet Abbas, on the White Nile, it was found that if the
rains were good the colonists would prepare the ground and sow the
crop, but if it came to artificial irrigation and shadoof work they
soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span> tired of this
heavier labour and left the crops to wither. Happily, a much better
account comes from Kassala. The Mudir of that province
reported:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>‘The colony of blacks established at Kassala continues to
thrive, and in every way justifies its existence. They have a
well-laid-out village, and are eager to cultivate along the Gash,
and have also a fair amount of rain crops. Labourers can nearly
always be obtained from amongst them for public works, and there
are some very fair masons who are permanently employed. I wish we
had the means of teaching some of them carpentry and blacksmith’s
work as well. They have acquired a good deal of small stock.</p>

<p>‘Those of Gedaref are not so thrifty, and are lazy; they do not
cultivate so much or so well, but I hope for improvement.’</p>
</div>

<p>Transport and communications are indeed vastly better than they
were in Egyptian days. The railway from Halfa to Khartoum makes an
all-important difference. It has already given an immense stimulus
to the export trade; without it there would have been quite another
tale to tell of the last five years. But except in the province of
Berber it does not tap any local resources. Great part of it lies
in an uninhabited desert. Every train leaving Halfa has to carry
with it 1,520 cubic feet of water. And there are 200 miles of river
between Halfa and the outer world at Assouan, and then 700 miles
more to the sea. Carriage of goods over such a mileage, with its
necessary transhipments, is a long and costly business, nearly
prohibitive for bulky articles. Coal, for example, is seldom less
than £4 a ton at Khartoum, and often nearer £6. No one who had to
build a railway in the Soudan for commercial purposes only would
think of crossing the desert to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_229">[229]</span> Halfa; his first thought would be to
connect Khartoum with the sea-board at Suakin.</p>

<p>There is also the railway from Halfa to Kerma, thirty miles from
Dongola. But this, too, was laid down in haste for military
purposes. It is laid so badly, with such sharp curves and such
steep gradients, owing to the nature of the country, that no heavy
trains can run on it, and with the present rolling-stock an engine
has sometimes to make three or four starts before it can master an
ascent. It is worked at a loss of about £20,000 a year, and it has
become a serious problem whether the money so spent could not be
employed much more advantageously elsewhere, so many are the claims
on the Soudan Exchequer. It would be far better to take up the
whole line, and relay it from Dongola to connect with the main-line
at Abu Hamed. For not only is this a much easier country, but the
southern part of the province, which is the richer, and inhabited
by a more industrious and hard-working population, would be opened
up. But at present no money is forthcoming either for this or for
the complete repair of the existing line. So poor Dongola is in the
tantalizing position of having a railway, and yet not being able to
take full benefit of it. It is actually suffering from a surplus of
foodstuffs, and is a year behindhand in its exports.</p>

<p>The province is famous for its dates; not only is it a great
exporter of the ordinary fruit, but it also produces a golden date,
which is said to be the best in the world, better, even, than the
Algerine date, so well known in Europe. It has also abundance of
irrigable land as good as Upper Egypt, which it very much resembles
in general climatic conditions. As its numerous and interesting
antiquities show, it once supported<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_230">[230]</span> a very large population; but now a great
deal of land is lying waste, and the population, though increasing
very fast, is still not more than about 100,000. With better
communications its prospects are very good. When Egypt becomes
overcrowded, as it must in time if the present rate of increase is
maintained, Dongola will offer a fair field to Egyptian
immigration. The conditions of life are so similar to those in
Egypt that it cannot fail to be the most attractive part of the
Soudan. Even as things are, owing to the partial advantage afforded
by the railway and facilities of transport by boat-carriage on the
Nile, the trade of the province is increasing. Cotton goods and
luxuries like tea, sugar, coffee, and perfumeries, are the
principal imports, and cereals are exported as well as dates. The
people are wealthier, and anxious to buy such goods as cutlery,
crockery, soap, agricultural implements, and hardware, but
well-to-do traders have not as yet exploited the field, as they
would do if the railway difficulty were solved.</p>

<p>Once Khartoum is connected with the sea by railway, the
principal obstacle in the way of trade will have been removed, and,
fortunately, this is no longer a mere vision of hopeful men.
Practically the railway has already been begun. It will strike
across the desert to the Atbara, crossing the mountains near
Sinkat, and then run along it to join the main-line near where it
crosses that river. If the railway does not come to Berber itself,
Berber will probably travel up the Nile to meet it. Arab towns are
not very difficult to shift. The whole route has been carefully
surveyed, and a good deal has been spent in improving the port of
Suakin. Materials are being rapidly collected. This time careful
preparations are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
being made; there will be none of those kaleidoscopic changes of
policy which were so fatal in 1885. It may confidently be expected
that in two or three years’ time there will be something to show
very much more substantial than a tennis-court at Dover built of
much-travelled material, the only result of our former exertions.
For the construction of the line the Government will be its own
contractor. The Soudan Railway Department has a very capable staff,
and they will be able to do the work as efficiently as any outside
contractor, and much more cheaply. It is hoped that as far as
possible native labour may be made use of. It is a hopeful
indication of a change of spirit among the Arabs that the local
sheikhs have agreed to bring their tribesmen to work; the
experiment is worth trying even if it fails. No such thing has ever
happened in the Soudan before.</p>

<p>Meantime Suakin is looking eagerly forward. Its inhabitants have
naturally suffered by the complete diversion of trade to the Nile
Valley route. Very few of them can even afford to repair their
houses, and the town shows signs of decay. Most of the people are
unemployed, and labour is very cheap. There was formerly a good
deal of trade with India and the Red Sea ports, but most of this
has fallen away, and nearly all the Indian merchants who formerly
had their headquarters there have left. But now that the desert
which shuts off the Soudan from the sea is really to be bridged
over, there will be a great change. The one seaport of these
immense territories cannot fail to be a busy and prosperous
place.</p>

<p>Once the new line is completed, the distance from Khartoum to
the sea will be reduced by about two-thirds,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_232">[232]</span> to some 450 miles, with a proportionate
reduction in expense of carriage, and it will then be possible to
think of building other feeder lines in various parts of the
Soudan. A branch line to Kassala and on to Gedaref and Gallabat
along the Abyssinian frontier will tap a very rich district and
open up the Abyssinian trade. Possibly in the distant future such a
line may be continued southwards so as to connect with Uganda. In
the recent agreement with Abyssinia, powers have been taken to
build in Abyssinian territory for this purpose. But this is still a
long way outside practical politics. Of far more importance for the
immediate development of the country would be a light railway from
Omdurman or Duem to El Obeid, or across the rich Ghezireh from Duem
to Wad Medani on the Blue Nile, or, again, from near Wad Medani to
Gedaref. Easy communication with the sea will render it possible to
bring the necessary plant into the country at a reasonable cost,
and the experience gained as to material and labour in building the
Suakin line will also be invaluable.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the provincial Governors are doing all they can to
improve the caravan routes and roads. In great part of the Soudan
this is simply a question of increasing the number of wells;
metalled roads are scarcely necessary as yet, outside a few towns.
Wheel traffic is almost non-existent; the camel and the ass are the
great public carriers. It is rather strange that the camel has not
been more used for pulling wheel transport than he has. One camel
can pull three or four times as much as he can carry. All the heavy
machinery of the Nile Valley Gold Mining Company, working in Nubia,
has been transported<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_233">[233]</span> in this way from the river, a distance of
sixty miles. Rarely a camel may be seen hauling a plough in Egypt.
But there are limits to the use of camels. They cannot breed
successfully south of parallel 13°, and in all the country south of
this the serut fly makes it almost impossible for either them or
horses to live at certain seasons of the year.</p>

<p>Above all, access to the sea will greatly stimulate the use made
of water carriage within the country. In the Nile and its
tributaries the Soudan possesses a system of natural trade-routes
unequalled in Africa for internal commerce. The river traffic,
though already growing, is merely in its infancy. The Government
has a considerable fleet of steam and sailing vessels between Wadi
Halfa and Assouan, and also on the Blue and White Niles. They are
also encouraging an English company which has placed some steamers
and steam-barges on both rivers. On the Blue Nile there is regular
steamer communication with Rosaires, 426 miles from Khartoum,
during high Nile, about six months in the year, and even in low
Nile most of the river is navigable by native boats. On the White
Nile, now that the sudd has been cleared, steamers and native boats
can ply the whole year round up to Gondokoro. In time the Sobat may
prove a very good route for trade with Abyssinia. And the Bahr el
Ghazal, with its network of waters, is in this respect the most
fortunate of all the provinces. Many of its waterways are still
blocked by sudd, but every year the navigation is improving. A
serviceable channel is now available on the Jur River as far as
Wau, and large steamers will eventually be able to get up even much
further than this. The other rivers will in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_234">[234]</span> time be opened up. In a country where at
present everything has to be carried on men’s heads, this will be
an extraordinary benefit from every point of view, and if the
province answers at all to its old reputation as one of the most
fertile spots of Africa, it will do very well, in spite of
mosquitoes, serut flies, malaria, guinea worm, and all its other
plagues.</p>

<p>As for the lack of capital both for private enterprise and
public works, that, like the lack of population, can only be cured
by time. Overhasty development could only do harm, even if it were
possible. As trade improves and agriculture develops, the people
will become more wealthy, and the two will react upon each other.
That large sums will be invested by private capitalists or firms is
not to be expected for years to come. But even now an Englishman is
erecting flour-mills at Wad Medani, and if his venture succeeds it
may be followed by others. The Government is doing all in its power
to encourage agriculture by small loans for the purchase of seeds,
water-wheels, and cattle to work them. Perhaps some form of
State-supported Agricultural Bank will be established.</p>

<p>The Soudan is an agricultural country; in that direction alone
can real progress be made, and the progress depends mainly upon
irrigation. Between the Atbara and the Blue Nile, and between the
Blue Nile and the White Nile, there is, as has been pointed out, a
great field for irrigation works on a large scale, but the amount
of crops now grown by direct irrigation is very small. Along the
Blue Nile water-wheels are numerous for the first ten miles above
Khartoum. There used to be 3,000 between Khartoum and Berber, but
in 1898 there were no<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_235">[235]</span> more than seventy; and though the number
has increased, it has yet nothing like reached the old level. The
same is true of the rest of Berber Province and of Dongola. There
is also a certain amount of irrigation on islands in the White Nile
above Khartoum. When the river is falling, large mud flats appear
in the centre of the stream. To these the people transport their
cattle and belongings; they sow their seed in the mud, build
themselves huts, and set up shadoofs to water the growing crops of
wheat, barley, dhurra, and onions. They begin operations towards
the end of January, and in good soil the crops are harvested by
May.</p>

<p>What perennial irrigation can do is shown by the gardens at
Khartoum, where lemons, figs, oranges, pomegranates, bananas,
vines, and all kinds of vegetables, grow in profusion all the year
round. But at present nearly all the crops are rain crops. The
height to which water has to be raised out of the Blue Nile is too
great for extended irrigation by mere lift. For the first 150 miles
from Khartoum the banks are 26 to 30 feet over the summer level,
and further south 33 to 39 feet, the difference between summer and
flood level being about 23 feet. The soil of the Ghezireh is a rich
alluvial deposit sometimes 150 feet deep. The inhabitants build
small dykes across the general slope of the country so as to
prevent the rain running off too quickly, and sow their seed as
soon as the rain has fallen. The result as described by Sir R.
Wingate a year or two ago is as follows:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>‘I recently rode from Wad Medani on the Blue Nile to opposite
Duem on the White Nile, eighty miles across a perfectly flat plain
sown almost throughout its entire<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_236">[236]</span> length with dhurra, which was standing 6 to
8 feet high. As there is only one crop sown during the short rainy
season, and as this is planted and harvested within a period of
sixty to eighty days, it follows that, if a system of irrigation
were possible in the Ghezireh it would become a huge granary
capable of supplying, not only the whole Soudan, but other
countries as well.’</p>
</div>

<p>But, of course, any schemes for utilizing the waters of the Nile
have always to be considered in reference to the prior claims of
Egypt. It is only to Egypt that the Soudan can look for the money
necessary to carry out great works, and, naturally, Egypt would not
allow irrigation to be developed in the Soudan unless her own needs
were amply safeguarded. Whenever Egypt undertakes the great works
contemplated on the Upper Nile, the Soudan will share in the
benefit. That will not be for a long time to come, and meanwhile
the Soudan has opportunity to develop her resources and her
population so as to be able to seize the chance when it comes.
There seems to be no reason, however, why works on a small scale
should not be undertaken, subject always to the question of
expense, to utilize in the Soudan, by means of basin irrigation on
the Blue Nile or the Atbara, some of the flood-water during July,
August and September, which is only an embarrassment to Egypt now
that perennial irrigation is adopted so universally in that
country. It is only in the preceding summer months, when the Nile
is low, that Egypt is forced to watch the proceedings of her
neighbour with such a jealous eye. It would be rash to prophesy
exactly when irrigation works will be undertaken, or what form they
will take; but it is certain that they will come, and when they do,
their effect upon the Soudan will<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_237">[237]</span> be immense. The subject is of peculiar
interest to England; the lands in question are capable of producing
other crops than cereals, and, as will presently be shown, for none
are they more suitable than for cotton.</p>

<p>Quite apart from any such speculations upon the future, the
external trade of the Soudan is capable of great expansion under
present conditions. An examination of the returns of imports and
exports during the last years before the rebellion is a very useful
guide to the capacities of the country. The figures are taken from
Colonel Stewart’s report.</p>

<p>There are no returns of imports except for the port of Suakin,
but these embrace practically the whole. Of course, a certain
amount came in by the Nile Valley route, just as now a certain
amount comes in by Suakin instead of by the railway. The position
has been practically reversed, and for purposes of comparison it is
fair to take the imports formerly entering the port of Suakin and
those now carried by the railway. The most important item was
cotton goods, which amounted to about 25,000 to 30,000 kantars
annually. Linens were about 200 to 300 kantars, and woollens 100 to
300 kantars. There was also a certain amount of silks and silk
thread and sewing cotton. The Indian trade brought in a good deal
of grain and tobacco. In 1881 the import of Indian rice amounted to
20,000 kantars. Petroleum (6,000 kantars), oil, zinc, copper, and
iron, appear in the list, as well as flour and provisions of
various kinds in large quantities, and candles, boots, and clothes.
The peculiar tastes of the Soudanese in luxuries are reflected in
the large imports of sandal-wood, and scents and perfumery,
especially fish-scent (700 tons, or 15,400<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_238">[238]</span> kantars, a year). Both men and women are
particularly fond of strong, greasy scents. In all native
festivities and entertainments these scents are a very prominent
feature, and a native marriage can be smelt a very long way off.
Last, but not least, comes a very peculiar item: in one year no
less than 11,000 dozen umbrellas were imported. There is certainly
enough sunshine in the Soudan, and in parts of it rain also, to
justify a large number of umbrellas, but it is difficult to believe
that 132,000 umbrellas would find a ready sale in the Soudan
to-day. Perhaps the Khalifa particularly disliked the
umbrella-carrying class.</p>

<p>In 1901 the imports of cotton goods had already reached their
former level, amounting to about 28,000 kantars. But the trade is
growing rapidly: in 1902 the imports had risen to 38,000 kantars.
Considering that the population is no more than a third of what it
was in 1881, this is striking testimony of the good effects
produced by just government and a railway. The imports from India
have, of course, fallen away. Scents are far below their former
figure, but the imports of flour and rice have risen; 343 tons of
flour and 43 tons of rice were carried in 1901, and 733 tons of
flour and 108 tons of rice in 1902. Tobacco, oil, and petroleum are
also increasing. There is also a very important article of import
which reflects both the improved purchasing power of the Soudan and
the increased production in Egypt; this is sugar. The railway
carried 1,700 tons in 1901, and nearly 3,000 tons in 1902. Soap,
likewise of Egyptian manufacture, also appears in the returns to
the extent of some 140 tons a year.</p>

<p>As for imports so for exports Suakin was the chief channel of
trade before the rebellion. But a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_239">[239]</span> good deal also went by Korosko and the
Nile, principally gum, senna, coffee, and ostrich feathers. An
inappreciable amount, probably, also filtered through to Egypt by
Assouan or Assiout. Far the biggest item of the recorded trade was
gum. The export for three years was—</p>

<td class="tdr pad-right2">150,861</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Next came cotton, cleaned and uncleaned, averaging about 20,000
kantars per annum. Coffee amounted to about 7,000 kantars,
principally from Kassala and the Abyssinian frontier. The Soudan is
a land of strange diseases, but it is also a land of medicines.
Besides tamarinds, as much as 3,300 kantars of senna was exported
in 1880. Ostrich feathers from Kordofan and Darfur came to about
200 kantars, and there was also about half that amount of
guttapercha from the Bahr el Ghazal. Miscellaneous exports included
skins and hides, mother-of-pearl from the coast, mats from Kassala,
and ivory.</p>

<p>To-day gum-arabic is still easily first among the exports. The
best kind of gum is the white gum produced from the gray-barked
acacia, called hashab; there are also inferior kinds called talh,
or latch, produced from the red-barked acacia. The gum is used for
giving a glaze to linens and other woven fabrics, for stiffening
cotton-stuffs and calicoes, and for making sweets and chewing
mixtures. Kordofan is the home of the gum trade; a good deal, but
chiefly the inferior kinds, comes from the forests of Sennar and
Kassala, but nearly all the best white gum comes from Kordofan,
especially the part round Taiara<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_240">[240]</span> between Duem and El Obeid. Here there are
limitless forests of hashab. The taking of the gum does not
permanently injure the tree, and the only obstacles to its
gathering are the distances to be travelled without water, and the
lack of labour. Every new well means a fresh productive area, and
people migrate temporarily from other parts of the Soudan for the
gum harvest. Most of it is brought down by boat from Duem, some
directly on camels from El Obeid to Khartoum, where it is sorted on
the beach. Of this first-rate white gum the Soudan has practically
a monopoly, and when the Soudan was closed to trade its price went
up enormously. This naturally brought out substitutes: inferior gum
from West Africa came into use, and glucose also took its place.
Still, there was a good demand for it after the re-occupation of
the Soudan, and in 1900 the price was still 65s. per cwt. Since
then the production has gone up by leaps and bounds, but,
unfortunately, this has been accompanied by a great fall in prices,
at one time as low as 27s. 6d. per cwt. The figures of the export
trade are:</p>

<p>The trade has now far outstripped its former limits. To a young
country, a profit of some £200,000 a year divided between the
merchants and producers on the one side and the Government on the
other by means of royalties and railway receipts is no mean
advantage.</p>

<p>As for the other former exports, the trade in<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span> ostrich feathers from Kordofan
and Darfur has begun again, and there seems no reason why it should
not be developed. Ostriches are farmed successfully in Egypt near
Cairo, and the conditions are even more favourable for their
establishment in the Soudan. Nor is it unlikely that the Soudan
will be able to supply a part of her own tobacco and sugar, which
now bulks so largely in the imports. In former days the sugar-cane
was cultivated largely in Dongola and along the Nile in Berber
Province. The fertile plains around Kassala bore crops both of
sugar-cane and tobacco. The district of Fazokhl, beyond Rosaires on
the Blue Nile, used to produce 1,000 kantars of tobacco per year.
It is also found in Fashoda; and in the south-western part of
Kordofan, where the soil is the richest in the province, both
tobacco and sugar-cane grow easily wherever there is water, to say
nothing of the Bahr el Ghazal. The coffee came principally from
that part of the country which has since been taken over by Italy
or Abyssinia, and, though it is grown in Kassala, the trade in it
is not likely to come to very much. This coffee, however, which is
of the Abyssinian kind, and not a first-class coffee, is still
quoted in the London market at about 50s. per cwt.</p>

<p>But the most promising feature in the old returns is the 20,000
kantars of cotton, even though as yet the trade has not revived.
Though the figure is in itself insignificant, it is a proof that
the thing can be done. Cotton is indigenous in the Soudan. It grows
wild in Fashoda, although the native Shilluks seem never to have
taken advantage of this circumstance, preferring to go completely
naked. Most of the former cotton export came from Kassala. The Khor
Gash, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span> tributary
of the Atbara, comes down in flood during July and August, and
partly inundates the plain, leaving behind a rich alluvial
deposit—splendid cotton soil. There was formerly a cotton factory
in Kassala town. In the districts of Gallabat and Gedaref cotton is
now actually being grown, and it is proving the foundation of
increasing trade with Abyssinia. Abyssinian merchants eagerly buy
up all that can be grown. Further south, in Sennar Province, the
valleys of the Dinder and the Rahad were once very famous for
cotton, which was also largely imported into Abyssinia. Here, too,
the cultivation is increasing as the people settle down. The
district of Tokar, near Suakin, along the Khor Baraka, produces,
perhaps, the best quality of all the cotton in the Soudan. It, too,
in former days produced very much more than now. While along the
Nile itself, in the neighbourhood of Khartoum and in Berber and
Dongola Provinces, enough cotton is grown to supply small local
industries, in which a rough white cloth is woven, one of the few
local manufactures in the Soudan. Beyond a doubt, not only is there
a great deal of land admirably suited to grow cotton in the Soudan,
but also the climatic conditions, given only water, are peculiarly
favourable.</p>

<p>Cotton and its culture are thus no novelties to the inhabitants
of the Soudan. The point is the water; it all comes back to water
and irrigation. If the Soudan is to be of any real interest to the
cotton-spinners of Lancashire, its export must be counted not by a
few paltry tens of thousands of kantars, but by hundreds of
thousands, perhaps by millions. And for that there must be
irrigation works on a large scale. The soil is there in the
Ghezireh and elsewhere,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_243">[243]</span> the climate is there, the water is there,
and the irrigation works will come. But once again, there is no
need for hurry. The interests of the whole Valley of the Nile have
to be considered. The undertaking is too large to be gone into
without the utmost care and patient deliberation.</p>

<p>It is eminently satisfactory that the Government is fully alive
to all the possibilities. They have started an experimental farm at
Shendi, where trials are being made of different sorts of cotton,
of different methods of culture, and of different periods of
sowing, as well as calculations of the cost of production and of
carriage to the ginning factories in Egypt. Already some most
interesting and important results have been obtained. It has been
definitely shown that the cotton which is sown in June and July
promises better, both in quality and quantity, than that sown in
the autumn or in March and April. At that time the heat is not so
great, and the river is rising, so that the cultivator gets his
water during the most necessary time at the least cost, because
with the least effort. If this is confirmed, it is extremely
important, for the water will be taken at a time when the Nile is
high, and when, therefore, Egypt can afford to allow it to be used
without suffering in the least degree, apart altogether from new
Reservoir works.</p>

<p>As regards quality, it appears that the cotton grown, if not so
good as the very best kinds of Delta cotton, is at least as good
as, or better than, the best American, both in colour and staple.
It is calculated that at the present time 1 acre producing 4
kantars will produce gross receipts of 1,060 piastres, against an
expenditure of 1,000 piastres, showing a profit of 60 piastres, or
12s. 6d. per acre. But when<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_244">[244]</span> the new railway has reduced the cost of
fuel for the pumps, and also the cost of carriage, the expenses
will be no more than 700 piastres, showing a profit of 360 piastres
per acre, or 75s. It is estimated that the new railway will reduce
the cost of freight by 50 piastres per kantar, and, wherever the
Soudan has its own ginning factories, the profits will, of course,
be all the greater, because only the prepared product will be
carried. There is at present sufficient local demand for cotton to
make it generally more profitable to sell it on the spot than to
carry it to Egypt, but as the production increases it will soon
outstrip the local demand. Any private capitalist investing money
in cotton in the Soudan would be able to buy and clear land on the
river in Berber or Dongola at from £5 to £6 per acre, so that he
would get a very reasonable return on his investment. He would have
the further advantage that in the Soudan two of the worst cotton
diseases, ‘worm’ and ‘hog,’ are unknown.</p>

<p>Cotton and corn are the two great foundations on which the hopes
of commercial prosperity in the Soudan are founded. The Negro
Soudan is still comparatively unexplored, and its resources cannot
be estimated. There is, however, a chance that the Bahr el Ghazal
will do great things in rubber. Rubber-trees are known to be
plentiful; rubber has already been produced in small quantities,
and specimens of absolutely first-class quality have been obtained.
But it has yet to be shown that the best kind of creepers are
numerous, and also that they can be successfully tapped without
killing the plants. So far, it does not seem likely that the Soudan
has any great sources of wealth underground. Iron is found and
worked in small quantities in the Bahr el Ghazal, and at
least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span> two ore beds
are known in Kordofan, but there is no fuel to work them, and no
means of transporting the ore. As for gold and the precious metals,
several prospecting licenses have been issued and search is being
eagerly made, but, except the copper mines of Hofrat-en-Nahas,
nothing has been discovered at present. The only known gold-bearing
district, the Beni-Shangul, is now included within the territories
of Abyssinia. Gold was formerly worked in this district by the
Egyptians, not at a profit, and perhaps, in any case, it is no
great loss to the Soudan (even if it had not already been occupied
by the Abyssinians), for that gold may not be discovered in the
Soudan is the earnest prayer of every official in the country. The
true wealth of the Soudan, such as it is, lies in its water and its
soil. A find of coal would be a very different matter, and much
more valuable than gold, but, though discoveries are constantly
being rumoured, coal is not yet.</p>

<p>No account of the commerce of the Soudan would be complete
without a mention of those wonderful people the Greek traders.</p>

<p>It is well known how, on the day after the Battle of Omdurman, a
Greek arrived in the town and opened a store with all kinds of
goods brought somehow from Suakin. This man is now a prosperous and
wealthy merchant, with large shops in Khartoum and Halfa, and a
finger in every sort of commercial undertaking. He is no longer
alone in the field. Whether it be true or not that trade follows
the flag, undoubtedly the Greek trader follows the British flag.
They are said to be principally Ionian Islanders, so perhaps they
have a hereditary liking for it. Just as from Alexandria to Halfa
every town in Egypt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
has its Greek traders, carrying on business as storekeepers,
dealers, and innkeepers, so, from Halfa to Gondokoro, from Suakin
to El Obeid, every town in the Soudan has its Greeks. They are
ubiquitous; in Khartoum and Omdurman alone they number about 800.
One wonders what they were all doing before the Soudan was open.
Some of them, no doubt, stayed on right through the Khalifa’s
time.</p>

<p>As a vulture scents carrion from afar, so the Greek scents any
possible opening for trade with the natives. The gum trade, the
feather trade, the corn trade, all are in his hands. There is
nothing that a native wants, however humble, from beads and
kerosene-tins to silver, that he will not sell, exactly in the form
required. Naturally a gambler, there is no speculation that he will
not undertake, no risk he will not run. He can stand any climate,
he can live in native huts, and eat native food. He may be
unscrupulous in his dealings, and he has to be sharply watched by
those in authority, but as a trade pioneer in a new country he is
invaluable, and his enterprise contributes largely to make life
possible for more exacting Europeans in desolate places. Some day,
perhaps, when the Arab has mastered his methods of trade, he will
find his match, but at present he holds the field.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span><a id=
"c21"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br>
<span class="less">TAXATION, REVENUE, AND EXPENDITURE</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">At</span> the beginning of every
year the Soudan Budget, with the estimates of receipts and
expenditure for the year, has to be submitted to the Egyptian
Council of Ministers. The total amount to be granted to the Soudan
from the Egyptian revenues is then decided, and any consequent
alterations in the Budget made. The Governor-General and the
Financial Secretary are responsible for seeing that the total sum
so granted by Egypt is not exceeded, but while this limit is
observed, credits can be transferred from one head to another
without reference to Cairo. Any special or unforeseen expenditure
can be defrayed by Egypt by special grants sanctioned by the
Egyptian Council of Ministers, and the Egyptian Minister of Finance
has at all times the right of inspection, audit, and supervision of
the Soudan Government accounts. Practically, of course, this means
that the finances of the Soudan are subject to the control of the
British Financial Secretary and the British Consul-General at
Cairo, but that the Soudan Government exercises a very wide
discretion as to the disposal of its revenues once realized.</p>

<p>The revenues of the Soudan are therefore at<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_248">[248]</span> present made up from three sources:
first, taxation, fees, licenses, etc.; secondly, the receipts of
certain earning departments—<i>e.g.</i>, railway, steamers, post,
and telegraphs; and thirdly, the contribution from Egypt. Of these
the third is still, it must be confessed, the most important, but
the first is steadily growing. Strictly speaking, the second should
not be included, for although the earnings of these departments are
materially increasing, and although without them very little could
be done, their annual accounts do not as yet show a profit, for
various reasons that will be explained.</p>

<p>The principles of taxation are not new. Many of the taxes are
the same in kind as those which were formerly in force not only
under Egyptian rule, but also under the Khalifa’s. It was wisely
decided that no innovations should be introduced based on Western
notions, unless they were unavoidable. The taxes are of a kind to
which the people have long been accustomed, but, of course, great
care is taken that they shall be fixed at a moderate rate, and that
no one shall pay more than is actually required by law. It was the
uncertainty of the amount to be paid, the illegal imposts levied by
the collector on his own account, and the dates at which they were
collected, that made the old taxes so often cruel and ruinous. The
uncertainty of the amount to be paid had, however, an attraction
for the Oriental. It varied with the circumstances of the year. The
Government wished to get all they could, and in a good year they
exacted a most excessive amount; but in a bad year they took little
or nothing at all. According to the Western system a fixed moderate
amount has to be paid<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_249">[249]</span> every year, and a whole or partial failure
of the crop is not considered any excuse. The latter system is, of
course, far the most just and economically sound, but it lacks the
elasticity of the other. It is the constant endeavour of European
administrators in Oriental countries to endeavour to combine the
advantages of both systems. In the Soudan the system of petitions
direct to the Governor-General is a means to secure this result.
When adequate cause is shown, he is able to remit taxation wholly
or partly, and there have been several cases in which he has done
so, notably in Berber and Dongola Provinces in 1900, when the low
Nile caused a great deal of land to be thrown out of cultivation.
Of course, such remissions are inclined to play havoc with a Budget
framed on careful estimates. It cannot be helped, and at any rate
it is only one of many difficulties which have to be encountered in
balancing a Soudan Budget. Unforeseen expenditure often becomes
necessary, but happily during the last two or three years the
receipts have been increasing unexpectedly also.</p>

<p>Although the taxes remain the same in principle, a comparison
with the former state of things shows the difference in the methods
of assessment and collection to be so great as to amount to a
revolution. Then, as now, the Government in the Soudan was,
according to the general rule in the East, the admitted owner of
the soil, and the cultivator had to pay a tax amounting to
one-tenth of the produce for its use. The actual sum to be paid
included all other taxes, as house-tax, animal-tax, and so on. Each
district was rated at so much in the Budget; this sum was divided
among the villages and communes<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_250">[250]</span> until the individual cultivator was
reached. The nomad and other tribes which did not cultivate the
soil were assessed at an annual tribute, according to their wealth
in camels, cattle, and horses. In Berber and Dongola the tax was
not on the produce of the land, but on the instruments of
irrigation. It varied according to the instrument and according to
the quality of land. One sakieh was calculated to be capable of
watering 8 acres, and if more land was cultivated an increase was
made in the tax. It has already been mentioned how these
water-wheels were often taxed in a sum far beyond their possible
earning capacity. It was the same with the assessment of the
districts and the tribute of the tribes. The official estimates
were seldom or never realized as far as the public exchequer was
concerned (although the bullying tax-collectors took much more for
themselves). Arrears accumulated, in spite of every effort, and
became a direct incentive to discontent and revolt. In the year
1879 the deficiencies of the amounts actually received below those
estimated ranged in the different provinces from 10 to 60 per cent.
The figures of the Budget were, in fact, pure fancy, especially
when the country was disturbed. But the thing was even worse than
it looked. Districts and tribes, though they might not pay all that
was asked, paid a great deal more than they could afford, and
consequently, as the money had to be found somehow, they found it
by indulging in the only prosperous trade—that of slavery. In other
words, the Soudan lived largely by expending its capital.</p>

<p>Owing to the alteration in the boundaries of the Soudan, it is
somewhat difficult to calculate what<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_251">[251]</span> the amount raised in taxation from the
present territories amounted to. As nearly as can be made out, it
was about £360,000 a year nominally, with a nominal deficit on the
whole administration in the same provinces of £70,000 a year.
Absolutely nothing was spent in the development of the country;
salaries, rations, and clothes for the army of occupation made up
almost the whole of the expenditure.</p>

<p>As compared to this, the actual sums raised in the Soudan by
taxation during the last four years have been as follows:</p>

<table class="left-padded2" id="t251">
<tr>
<th>
</th>
<th class="pad1">£E.</th>

<td class="tdr pad-right1">200,000<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But the conditions are so different that nothing can really be
deduced from this comparison. The figures show clearly that the
country is advancing steadily. The burden is lightly borne. It
would be very easy to exact far more than this without any positive
discontent, but it would be a most unwise policy to do so, for it
would be at the expense of its future progress.</p>

<p>The taxes are no longer assessed by the district. The tribute
from the nomad tribes is the only exception to the rule that the
Government deals directly with the individual taxpayer. They are no
longer collected by irregular and irresponsible bullies; they are
payable at the most convenient seasons, and they are moderate in
amount. So great a difference in detail is almost a difference in
principle;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span> but the
names are the same. Of the whole collected the receipts from
land-tax and ushur are about a quarter—<i>i.e.</i>, about £50,000 a
year. The land-tax proper is no longer levied according to the
instruments of irrigation, but, as in Egypt, according to the
acreage and situation of the irrigated fields. Land irrigable by
wells and foreshore land irrigable by flood pays 20 piastres (4s.)
per acre; land on the mainland irrigable by water-wheels and
shadoofs, 30 to 40 piastres; and land on islands similarly
irrigable, 50 to 60 piastres. All other lands—that is to say, lands
which depend for their water-supply not on irrigation, but on
rainfall—are taxed at the rate of 10 per cent. <em>ad valorem</em>
on their produce. This tithe is called ushur. At first it was paid
almost entirely in kind, but it is now collected as far as possible
in money, and, as the money in circulation increases, payment in
kind—a most inconvenient form of payment—will be altogether
abolished. The date-tax—2 piastres (5d.) on every date-palm that
has begun to bear fruit—is akin to the land-tax. It produces some
£15,000 a year.</p>

<p>The land-tax in some form will be the staple of the future
revenues of the Soudan. Every year as population increases and more
land comes under cultivation it will form a larger proportion of
the total receipts. In many of the remote parts of the country,
owing to the great distances and the small number of officials, it
is hardly yet in working order, but with improved organization all
may be expected to bear their just share of taxation, and the
receipts will benefit accordingly. Any large scheme of irrigation
and cotton culture will, of course, send up this branch of revenue
by leaps and bounds. Second<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_253">[253]</span> in importance to the land-tax, and for the
time being exceeding it, come the royalties charged on exports of
gum, ostrich-feathers, ivory, india rubber, and a few other
articles, at the rate of 20 per cent. by weight. The extraordinary
growth of the gum-trade is mainly responsible for this item, which
makes up another quarter of the taxation revenue. Ivory receipts
can hardly be expected to come to very much, but ostrich-feathers
and rubber will probably show a marked increase in future
years.</p>

<p>Other minor receipts were estimated in the Budget for 1902 as

<p>All these taxes are familiar in the Soudan. Some of them,
especially those small in their results—and there are a good number
more of less importance than those named—will probably be abolished
as soon as the country is able to stand the immediate loss. But as
yet even the most objectionable in principle do not act as
restrictions to trade. They only distribute the burden of a very
light taxation, so as to make all classes contribute something, and
the Government is still so poor that even a few hundred pounds are
of very great importance.</p>

<p>The Customs are set down as producing only<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_254">[254]</span> £E5,400, and this demands a word of
explanation. £4,500 of this is taken at the port of Suakin, the
remainder on the land frontier in Kassala and Sennar. The Customs
on the land side, small as they are, show a steady increase; those
at Suakin have been constantly decreasing, as trade is more and
more diverted to the Nile Valley route. But all Customs duties on
goods coming to the Soudan on this side are levied at the Egyptian
ports, and retained by Egypt. The duties are 20 per cent. per kilo
on tobacco, and 8 per cent. <em>ad valorem</em> on all other goods.
In the year 1903 it is estimated that the sum thus retained by
Egypt will amount to £E70,000, but this has not been taken into
account in calculating the Soudan revenues.</p>

<p>As for the profit-earning departments, their profits are as yet
invisible—invisible, that is, as far as their accounts are
concerned, though visible enough in the increasing prosperity of
the country. Still, the actual takings of the railway and the post
and telegraphs mark progress. They stand for three years:</p>

<p>But these receipts are far from being any criterion of the
actual amount of work done. They exclude all that was done on
Government account. Up till 1903 all passengers, goods, and
messages on behalf of Government were carried free of charge. But
it was found that this system tended to extravagance.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span> A department, for example,
wishing to buy dhurra for Khartoum, was apt to buy it at Dongola,
possibly at a cheaper rate, and have it brought by rail for
nothing, rather than buy it locally and disburse something for the
cost of local camel or mule transport. This was good business for
the department, which had only a certain credit allotted to it, but
waste from the point of view of the railway, by which the cost of
transport was borne. Now each department is charged in the books of
the railway or post-office for all services actually rendered. The
change is, of course, only one of book-keeping, but it is a good
instance of the way in which good book-keeping works towards
economy. With this alteration the working of the profit-earning
departments makes a much better appearance. The estimates for 1903
are:</p>

<p>The maintenance of the army in the Soudan is the item most
affected by this alteration. The sum to be paid to the Egyptian War
Department is set down at £E193,658 for 1903 as against £E122,548
for 1902.</p>

<p>The Steamers and Boats Department has been too recently
organized for an opinion to be formed upon its working, but the
Railways are soundly and economically managed. The increase of
traffic has made it possible to reduce the ratio of working
expenses, though the high price of fuel is still a great obstacle.
Besides the ordinary expenditure there has also<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span> been a good deal of capital
expenditure, which was very necessary considering the haste with
which the line was laid down as a purely military railway. These
sums are: In 1899, a special credit of £E390,000 for the completion
of the line from the Atbara to Khartoum; in 1900, a special credit
of £E15,000 for culverts and bridges on the same portion of the
line, and a loan of £E55,000 for general development and purchase
of rolling-stock; and in 1902-1903, a loan of £E528,000 (spread
over five years) for the same purposes; and a special advance of
£10,000 for the survey of the proposed Suakin-Berber line. All
these sums, together with an advance of £E31,000 for the
improvement of the harbour at Suakin, have been found by Egypt. The
Soudan pays 2½ per cent. on the loans.</p>

<p>The nature of the country makes it inevitable that the postal
service should show a loss for some time; but the telegraph service
would show a profit over actual working expenses, but for the fact
that so much is expended every year on extension, and this is
credited to ordinary expenditure. £E18,500 was, however, borrowed
from Egypt in 1900 to meet a special difficulty. The wooden poles
were sometimes devoured by white ants, and were also liable to rot.
After various experiments it was found best to bolt the poles on to
steel bases, and it was to meet this emergency that the loan was
contracted. The new plan has been found to answer admirably, and it
has also facilitated telegraph extension, because the shorter poles
(12 ft. 6 in. instead of 18 ft.) make a much more convenient load
for a camel. Besides the wires along the railway, there is now
telegraphic communication from Berber to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_257">[257]</span> Suakin, Suakin by Tokar to Kassala, Kassala
to Gedaref, and Gedaref to Gallabat. A line from Gedaref connects
at Messalamia with a line down the Blue Nile from Khartoum by Wad
Medani to Sennar, which then crosses over to Goz Abu Goma on the
White Nile, and is continued to Fashoda. Another line runs from
Khartoum to Duem, on the White Nile, and thence to El Obeid. In
time the telegraph will be continued south to Uganda, and whenever
this takes place the telegraph tariff convention arranged by Mr.
Cecil Rhodes for through communication between Alexandria and Cape
Town will come into force.</p>

<p>If the gross takings of the railways, post and telegraphs, and
boats, are included in the revenues of the Soudan, the Budget wears
a more imposing aspect than if only the net expenditure of each of
these departments is included. The estimates for 1903 stand
thus:</p>

<p>By starving the administration it would be possible to make this
deficit a great deal less, and, on the other hand, it would be very
easy to make it a great deal more. A country which has been going
steadily, even rapidly, backwards for so many years affords
unlimited opportunity for capital expenditure. Indeed, a large part
of its ordinary expenditure is really capital, so far as it is
incurred for permanent buildings, railways, telegraphs,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span> all the other
machinery, not only of government, but of elementary civilization,
which were all entirely wanting. The item of public works bulks
very large in the civil expenditure. It is inevitable that the
expenditure should increase with the development of the country,
but it is a satisfactory symptom that it is not increasing so fast
in proportion as the revenue. The civil expenditure, too, goes up,
while the military expenditure goes down. In the following table
only the net expenditure on railways, etc., is included:</p>

<p>The richer provinces in the Soudan might prosper very much
faster if they were allowed to devote the whole of their own
revenues to the development of their own resources. But, of course,
the whole receipts have to go into the common purse, and then be
doled out again in the interests of the country as a whole.
Naturally, there is a tremendous fight every year between the
Mudirs, who are responsible for the provincial budgets, and the
central Treasury. Two provinces stand out prominently in the matter
of profits—Kordofan and Dongola. Dongola had pride of place at
first, but then Kordofan passed in a stride, through the revival of
the gum trade. But Dongola is still a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_259">[259]</span> good second, in spite of her railway
difficulties, through the date-tax and the land-tax. Two-thirds of
the whole amount raised by this latter tax is supplied by her.
Halfa Province, or, rather, District, also shows a good profit by
means of the land and date taxes. The Ghezireh Province, the kernel
of the Soudan, makes a favourable appearance. Sennar just pays its
way. The others all show a deficit. Khartoum, of course, stands in
a different category, as also Suakin. But Berber and Kassala may
soon be expected to redeem themselves. Fashoda is as yet very
undeveloped, and naturally the Bahr el Ghazal, only just occupied,
comes well at the bottom of the list. That this order of financial
merit will be maintained unchanged is most unlikely.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the estimated deficit for 1903 was some
£E390,000, and this is Egypt’s contribution towards the current
expenses of the year. The same sum was contributed in 1902, and it
has been agreed that this subsidy shall be continued at the same
figure for some years to come. The approximate amounts so expended
in former years were: 1899, £E385,000; 1900, £E417,000; and the
same in 1901. On the basis of this contribution, which is called
‘Insuffisance,’ the estimates for the Soudan are drawn up.
Considering all the difficulties in the way of accurate
calculations, it speaks well for the Soudan officials that their
expectations have been so nearly realized. In 1899 and 1900, when
the accounts were finally made up, there were found to be deficits
of £E23,000 and £E40,000. But in 1901 the finances of the country
took a great turn for the better, and, although expenditure
exceeded the estimate, this excess was<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_260">[260]</span> so much overbalanced by unforeseen increase
of receipts that sufficient surpluses were realized in 1901 and
1902 to make good the deficiencies of the two previous years.
During the years 1899-1903 Egypt has therefore expended close upon
£2,000,000 in these annual grants; she has also paid over, partly
as special credits and partly as loans, another £1,000,000 for
capital expenditure on railways and telegraphs, as already
mentioned. There are deductions to be made from this sum of
£3,000,000 in calculating the actual cost imposed on Egypt by the
Soudan; but as these are the actual amounts on which the Soudan
Budget is calculated, they must be set down here.</p>

<p>It sounds, perhaps, a strange thing to say that the Soudan
finances are in a sound condition when such sums have to be
contributed by Egypt, but such is certainly the fact. The great
feature is the recuperative power of the country, so markedly
displayed since 1901, and there can be no doubt that if, with
Egypt’s help, the two principles of low taxation and irrigation can
be steadily applied, they will produce, if not as great, yet a
similar result to that which they have produced in Egypt
itself.</p>

<span class="less">THE COST OF THE SOUDAN TO EGYPT</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> Nile Valley presents
some peculiar examples of political organization. At one end of it
is Uganda, a British Protectorate under the administration of the
Foreign Office. At the other is Egypt, nominally an independent
despotism, tempered by international Boards of Control in several
departments, notably finance, and paying tribute to a suzerain
Power—Turkey—but in the military occupation of England. Between
comes the Soudan, where, except at Suakin, the British and Egyptian
flags fly side by side. It is ruled by a Governor-General, joint
representative of the King and the Khedive, whose acts have to be
approved by the British Consul-General at Cairo, and it is jointly
occupied by the troops of both Powers. If it is difficult to decide
upon the exact position of Egypt, what shall be said of the Soudan?
International jurists have in it a fair field of problems on which
to exercise their wits, not to mention the peculiar status of the
Lado enclave. But whatever imaginary difficulties may be conceived,
one thing is certain: the hoisting of the British flag leaves no
doubt of the fact that the Soudan is not in any way a part of the
Turkish Empire. The difficulties and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_262">[262]</span> complications which have been caused in
Egypt by the Capitulations and the consequences derived from them
definitely cease with the boundaries of Egypt. It is easy to see
that those who framed the Convention of 1899 were thoroughly
determined on this. Article VIII. lays down that the mixed
tribunals shall not extend to the Soudan, except Suakin, and, to
further preclude any chance of international trouble, it is
expressly stated that no Consuls or other foreign representatives
shall be permitted in the Soudan without His Britannic Majesty’s
consent, and that no special privileges shall be accorded to the
subjects of any one or more Powers to trade, reside, or hold
property, within the limits of the Soudan.</p>

<p>Otherwise, there was no reason why the Soudan should not have
been placed in exactly the same position as Egypt, whatever that
may be. In every other respect it is, in fact, in the same position
as though the Egyptian flag flew alone, especially in the matter of
cost. When the British taxpayer is looking at a map of the world in
order to get some satisfaction for his Imperial expenditure, and
casts his eyes over Africa, he doubtless comforts himself with the
reflection that in the Soudan England governs, but Egypt pays, and
wishes that other portions of the Empire were managed on similar
principles. England governs, and Egypt pays, but the division of
labour is not unfair. If the Egyptian finds it hard to realize the
meaning of a veiled Protectorate, the more unsophisticated
Soudanese would find it totally impossible. The flag is a visible
symbol which appeals to him directly, and contributes largely to
the maintenance of peace. Many<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_263">[263]</span> a tribe submits contentedly to British
dominion, which would indignantly scout the idea of submission to
Egypt alone. As a matter of fact, the British Government does
contribute something in money, for it bears the cost of the British
battalion at Khartoum and its barracks. Still, it is to the
Egyptian Treasury, and not the British, that the Soudan has to
look, and it is worth while to estimate rather closely the sums
which Egypt has to find, and the advantages which it gains in
return.</p>

<p>The cost of the Soudan Campaign from the opening of the Dongola
Campaign in 1896 to February, 1899, was £2,345,345, made up as
follows:</p>

</table>

<p>Since then, up to the end of 1903, the ordinary expenditure of
Egypt in the Soudan has been, as was shown, about £2,000,000, and
the capital expenditure about another £1,000,000. In other words,
the Soudan has cost Egypt nominally about £600,000 a year for the
last five years.</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact the real cost during the five years has
been a good deal less than this. Various deductions ought to be
made. In the first place, Egypt takes all the Custom duties on
goods going through to the Soudan. These came to about £60,000 in
1902, and were estimated at about £70,000 for 1903, an estimate
very likely to be below the mark. It is safe to reckon that
during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span> the five
years they amounted to nearly £200,000. Then, the expenses of the
Egyptian army of occupation in the Soudan are charged to the Soudan
Government. During the first two years these amounted to about
£300,000 per annum. Taking an average of £200,000, we get a sum of
£1,000,000 under this head. If the Soudan had not been reconquered,
Egypt would have had to maintain nearly as large an army as at
present, and although the cost of maintenance is naturally larger
in the Soudan, it would not be unfair to deduct another £800,000 as
money that must have been expended in any case. Of the capital
expenditure, £600,000 was in loans for railway and telegraph
development. Although the prospect of repayment of these loans is
somewhat remote, they ought not to be written off as pure
out-of-pocket expenses, seeing that the Soudan Government pays 2½
per cent. per annum upon them. Two and a half per cent. on £600,000
is equal to 5 per cent. on £300,000. An investment with this return
would be more advantageous to Egypt than extinguishing an equal
portion of her debt, and it is therefore reasonable to deduct that
sum from the total expenditure. All these allowances added together
make up a sum of £1,300,000, bringing the average annual cost to
Egypt during the five years down to £340,000; while in addition to
all this the Egyptian revenues have also directly benefited through
the Railways and Post-office by the extra passengers, goods,
letters, telegrams, and money orders, passing to and fro.</p>

<p>Still, when all deductions have been made, it cannot be denied,
especially as the Soudan still calls loudly for more capital
expenditure, that the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_265">[265]</span> reoccupation of that country, from a
strictly financial point of view, though in one aspect
philanthropic, is not as yet philanthropy at 5 per cent. But there
are certain solid advantages which, though their value to Egypt is
difficult to calculate in terms of money, are worth to her many
times over the actual sum which the Soudan costs her.</p>

<p>First of all comes the fact, so often insisted upon, that the
whole of the upper waters of the Nile are now in the secure
possession of those who are responsible for her welfare. This
supreme and vital necessity overshadows all others, and would by
itself have forced her to undertake almost any sacrifice. In fact,
as all the water in Egypt comes through the Soudan, her
contribution may be looked upon as a water-rate calculated at an
exceedingly low figure. Secondly, she is relieved from all fear of
foreign invasion. The frontier is once more at rest, and no longer
troubled even by raids. There is a vast difference between a
peaceful and comparatively prosperous neighbour and a horde of
furious barbarians hammering at her gates.</p>

<p>Further, the pacification of the Soudan enabled the burden of
conscription to be diminished. The army was reduced by 5,500 men,
and the period of service was reduced from fifteen years to ten, of
which five have to be spent with the colours, and five in the
reserve or police. Considering how much the Egyptian fellah
dislikes military service, those who are affected by this change
probably regard it as the greatest benefit of all.</p>

<p>A new field has also been opened for Egyptian trade and the
employment of Egyptians. A constantly expanding market at her door
for sugar and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span> other
goods is no small advantage. A good deal of the money spent in the
Soudan, though lost to the Egyptian Treasury, is not lost to Egypt,
for it takes the form of salaries for numbers of Egyptians in the
Government service, and the money orders passing from the Soudan to
Egypt show that at least a portion of it returns immediately.
Moreover, the Soudan is gradually losing its old traditional
terrors, and more and more Egyptians, though as yet in small
numbers, are returning to settle there when their period of service
is over.</p>

<p>Lastly, the good name of Egypt has been restored; one of the
evil pages in her history has been finally turned. The country
which she once ruined by her misgovernment and oppression and by
her greedy haste to share in the profits of the slave-trade, and
then abandoned to barbarism, has been rescued, and set moving once
more on the paths of civilization and good government. It is right
that in the days of her prosperity she should do something to
assist her less fortunate neighbour.</p>

<p>It has been said that for the present Egypt will continue her
annual grant to the Soudan of £E390,000 a year. But she will also
be called upon to find some large additional sums. The Soudan
requires capital, but has no credit of her own on which to borrow.
The British taxpayer ought not to be called upon, even if he had
not borne his share already, since it is not his interests, but
those of Egypt, which are primarily concerned. But Egypt herself is
not in a position, owing to international complications, to
contract new loans, nor is it at all desirable to impose additional
taxation for the purpose. Private enterprise, even if it
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span> possible to
employ it, would in the end be too expensive. But the problem is
not insoluble, though difficult. Lord Cromer in his last report
gives a most admirable summary of the position:</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>‘I hope and believe that, although the difficulties are
considerable, they will not prove insurmountable. A hopeful feature
of the future is to be found in the fact, on which I have dwelt at
some length in my Egyptian Report, that the programme of fiscal
reform in Egypt is now completed. It cannot be doubted that the
people of Egypt are now very lightly taxed. Strongly as I should
object to any increase of Egyptian taxation for Soudanese purposes,
I can see no objection whatever to maintaining such taxes as at
present exist, partly with a view to providing the capital
necessary for the improvement of the Soudan. Indeed, far from there
being any objection, I believe the adoption of such a course to be
strictly in accordance with Egyptian interests; for, until capital
is spent, the Egyptian Treasury cannot hope that any considerable
reduction in the present Soudan deficit will be possible. I am, of
course, aware that the purely Egyptian requirements, such as
improved justice and police, to which allusion is made in my
Egyptian Report, must, in this connection, take precedence of the
necessities of the Soudan, great though these latter be. I am,
however, not without hope that, if due care and deliberation be
exercised, if the projects on which capital is spent be chosen
after a thorough examination of their merits and practicability,
and if everything in the nature of undue haste and precipitation be
avoided, money in fairly adequate quantities may eventually be
found both for the improvement of the Egyptian administrative
services and for the development of the Soudan.</p>

<p>‘There can be no question as to the direction in which capital
expenditure is most required. As I have said in my Egyptian Report,
the construction of the Suakin-Berber Railway is absolutely
essential to the well-being of the Soudan. I need only add that all
the testimony which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
I received during my recent visit to the Soudan strongly confirmed
me in the opinion which I had previously held on this subject.’</p>
</div>

<p>Such words coming from Lord Cromer are full of hope and
encouragement for the administrators of the Soudan. The man who
found means to overcome the financial difficulties of the Reservoir
works at Assouan is more than likely to surmount those of the
Suakin-Berber Railway.</p>

<p>In the long-run Egypt herself will benefit as well as the
Soudan. Of course, most of the trade now passing through Egypt will
return to its natural channel by Suakin and the Red Sea. The
Customs now taken at Alexandria will go directly to the Soudan, but
as soon as this happens a corresponding reduction can be made in
the Egyptian contribution. Nor will purely Egyptian trade with the
Soudan suffer. The Nile Valley route will remain, but it will be
cheaper for goods from Lower Egypt to travel via Suez and Suakin.
The import as well as the export trade of the Soudan will be vastly
encouraged, and every step forward in prosperity will make her a
better market for the goods of Egypt as well as those of other
countries. Once the railway is made, but not till then, there is a
possibility of the revenues of the Soudan improving sufficiently to
make the country self-supporting, and able to dispense entirely
with any annual grant from Egypt.</p>

<p>It is calculated that the construction of the new railway will
cost £2,500,000. Taking this as a basis, and assuming that Egypt
was able to make an arrangement under which the money should be
repaid by annual instalments over a period of ten years, with
interest at 5 per cent., it would involve<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_269">[269]</span> an average annual addition to her
expenditure of £318,750, or a total cost of ten times that sum. If
the period was twenty years, the average annual cost would be
£185,625, or, say, £200,000. It is rash for an outsider to
speculate on such subjects, and the figures are merely given as a
rough illustration; but it seems certain that Egypt could easily
bear any such burden. Nor does it appear a sanguine forecast to
estimate that within ten years of the completion of the railway the
revenues of the Soudan will have so greatly benefited, both by the
direct cheapening of supplies, fuel, and other material, and by the
development of trade generally, that at least a saving of £200,000
a year will accrue to Egypt, even if she still finds it prudent to
contribute something.</p>

<p>What future capital Egypt will have to find must be uncertain.
The whole situation will be changed by the advent of the railway.
But if all the signs of the times can be trusted, whatever her
expenditure may be, she will have no reason to repent of it.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p><span class="sc">Note</span>.—Since the above was in print, new
light has been thrown on the subject by a passage in the Note on
the Budget for 1904 by Sir Eldon Gorst, Financial Adviser to the
Khedive:</p>

<p>‘The Council of Ministers has authorized the Ministry of Finance
to advance out of the Special Reserve Fund the amount required for
the construction of a railway to connect the Valley of the Upper
Nile near Berber with the Red Sea at Suakin. The preliminary survey
of the proposed line has been completed, and an estimate of its
cost prepared. The total sum required, which amounts to about
£E1,770,000, will be spread over a period of from three to four
years, so that there should be no difficulty in meeting the charge
out of the annual increment of the Special Reserve Fund, but it
will be obviously undesirable to sanction any further large grants
out of the fund during this period. The construction of the railway
will be put in hand without delay, and if no unforeseen contingency
occurs, it may be hoped that it will be available for traffic in
about three years’ time.’</p>

<p>The Special Reserve Fund is made up of the free balance
remaining at the disposal of the Egyptian Government when all other
claims on their receipts have been settled.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h2><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span><a id=
"c23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br>
<span class="less">CONCLUSION</span></h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Some</span> time ago a small
detachment of Egyptian troops was passing through a village in a
remote and primitive part of Kordofan. A soldier of the party,
going to draw water at the well, there met, like Jacob, one of the
daughters of the people, who helped him in his task. Out of
gratitude for her assistance or admiration for her charms, he gave
her one of the few things he had to offer, a large red cotton
handkerchief. Attired in it, the damsel excited the admiration and
envy of all her fellows, and from this chance seed arose a demand
for Manchester cotton goods. But as the desired articles could not
be purchased for nothing, the supply of charitable soldiers being
limited, the inhabitants had to apply themselves to the collection
of gum in order to be able to satisfy their wants. And thus the
exports improved as well as the imports.</p>

<p>In different forms the same process is going on all over the
Soudan, and the sternest admirer of Arcadian simplicity could
hardly deny that the people are happier and better because of it.
The country is not such an El Dorado that they are likely to be
corrupted by excessive wealth. Their awakening needs can only be
satisfied by means of habits of industry.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_271">[271]</span> Thanks to good government they are able on
the one hand securely to enjoy the fruits of their labour, and on
the other hand, they are prevented from taking any short-cuts to
fortune by raiding their neighbours and selling them into
slavery.</p>

<p>If it were necessary to justify British interference in the
Soudan, the fact of the repression of slavery would alone be
sufficient. If the slave-trade does still exist, it does so only
precariously in a few remote holes and corners. The markets of
Khartoum and Omdurman and other centres are greater and more
various than they have ever been before, but this one traffic, once
their principal feature, is absent and gone for ever. No change
could be greater or eventually more beneficial in its effects on
the whole life and character alike of the slave-owners, the
slave-dealers, and those unhappy tribes who involuntarily furnished
their material.</p>

<p>The establishment of personal liberty and of security for life
and property, elsewhere the commonplaces of government, is not
always the result of civilization in Africa. They are new, at any
rate, in the Soudan. But it would ill become the English rulers of
the Soudan to take any credit to themselves if their five years’
record had no more to show than this. They must not be content to
be judged by comparison with any former rulers. After the Khalifa’s
tyranny, almost any government would seem mild and beneficent. It
is not enough merely to have stanched the wounds by which the
patient was bleeding to death; the foundations must be laid for his
complete restoration to health and vigour. Judged by this test,
however, they need not fear the verdict.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty is the universal ignorance and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span> superstition that prevail. But
these ancient fortresses are being directly assaulted every day by
the extension of a sound system of education. The strong
administration of equal justice, and the increasing growth of trade
and commerce, work powerfully in the same direction. All three
agents are stimulated by the improvement of communications by
river, road, and railway. There is hope in the fact that, though
the people start from a very low level, their past has not been one
of complete barbarism. Although Egyptian and dervish rule repressed
all habits of industry and culture, the people of the country which
was once the kingdom of Sennar had considerable repute as weavers,
goldsmiths, curriers, and potters. They still practise a native
form of inoculation for small-pox. And, to take their traditions
still further back, it is said that in some places, in the
elaborate dressing of their hair and the use of ornamental sandals
on great occasions, they reproduce the fashions of ancient Egypt.
Ed Damer, near the junction of the Atbara and the Nile, now a
paltry village, had once a university of its own no less than
Sennar.</p>

<p>Time, of course, must be allowed for these influences to work.
Not in five years and not in one generation can the evils
deep-rooted in the past be swept away. Though all the reforms have
been introduced most cautiously, and with great regard for the
prejudices and traditions of the people, it is still sometimes
necessary to teach a sharper lesson, and to clearly advertise the
fact that if the Government is benign and merciful it is not
because it is weak. When such occasions do arise, as in the case of
the last in the succession of Mahdis, suppressed a few months ago
in Southern Kordofan, there is no fumbling and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_273">[273]</span> delay. The blow is struck at once and
decisively. There is a wonderful difference between a prophet with
a divine mission to regenerate Islam by force of arms slaughtering
a rabble of ill-led Egyptian peasants, and an impostor unable to
free himself from prison, or dangling from a gallows in El Obeid
after being captured in the field and fairly tried with all the
forms of law.</p>

<p>Such incidents, when properly handled, are only ripples on the
general calm. There have been rumours from time to time of troubles
likely to arise from the action of the Sheikh-es-Senussi. There
were internal troubles in the kingdom of Wadai, which lies to the
west of Darfur, and it was thought that these might force him to
abandon his peaceful attitude, for his influence is predominant in
that country. It would undoubtedly be dangerous if he were to
proclaim a holy war, for he has many adherents in the Soudan as
well as in Egypt. But until now his sect has been founded on rules
of conduct, and he and his predecessors have steadily refused to
adopt a militant attitude. The Mahdi was a good deal afraid of him,
and nominated him as one of his Khalifas, but he refused to accept
the position. It is now announced that the French have occupied
Wadai; we have every reason to welcome them as neighbours. Wadai
was one of the few remaining strongholds of the slave-trade, and
its suppression there will facilitate the operations of the Slavery
Department in Western Kordofan. And should any trouble arise from
the followers of the Sheikh-es-Senussi or any other sect in that
quarter, it will be a great advantage to have the co-operation of
the French, who would have the same interest as
ourselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span> in
speedily putting it down. On the other side, now that the frontier
is settled, there is not likely to be trouble with the Abyssinians,
and the Italians in Eritrea and Massowah are the best of
neighbours.</p>

<p>It may some day be necessary to interfere in Darfur, though not
during the reign of the present Sultan, Ali Dinar. Ali Dinar has
seen something of the world; he is a vigorous ruler, and he
understands very plainly that his interests lie in keeping on good
terms with the Soudan Government. But some day Ali Dinar will be
gathered to his fathers, and possibly some Rehoboam will succeed
him, who will cause internal dissensions, or someone afflicted with
Napoleonic ideas, who will have to be chastised. Sooner or later,
something of the kind is bound to happen, but it is to be hoped
that a country so remote from the Nile will continue under its
native rulers as long as possible.</p>

<p>What the future political status of the Soudan will be depends
upon the course of events in Egypt. As long as Lord Cromer is
there—and long may it be—everyone may feel easy. But when some
lesser man has to stand as buffer between Egypt and the Foreign
Office, it may make a great difference whether Egypt takes her
place as definitely a part of the British Empire or not. Every year
the number of British civilians in the Soudan service is growing.
Great as have been the services of the officers of the Egyptian
army, their employment has this disadvantage, that they are liable
to be called away just when they are most required, and when they
have thoroughly learned the business of administration. It has been
good for the Soudan to have the choice of some of the
most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span> capable
officers in the British Army for her civil work, and a spell of
civil administration is excellent training for the soldier. But a
glance at the names of the governors and inspectors of provinces
year by year shows what a number of changes there are under the
system. Some of them will probably throw in their lot definitely
with the Soudan; but this can only be counted upon in exceptional
cases. As administration becomes more complicated, it will be less
possible for the soldier to take up the reins as he can now.
Specially trained men will be more and more necessary. But at
present the Soudan civil service is a water-tight compartment. Its
members are in a doubtful sort of position. They are not in the
Egyptian service, nor in the British Colonial Service, nor are they
definitely under the Foreign Office. Up till now there has been no
difficulty in recruiting the small number of capable civilians
required. But as the number increases there may be some difficulty
in obtaining sufficient candidates of the right stamp. Unless the
country becomes very much more wealthy, it has no great prizes to
offer. But if the whole Nile Valley were in practice regarded as
one country, which it really is, and all under one head, with one
combined civil service, there would be much more scope for able
men, and each part of it would benefit by the possibilities of
interchange.</p>

<p>It would be a great piece of organization; but, with Indian
experience before us, there is no reason why it should not be a
success. Direct administration ought not to be in the hands of the
Foreign Office, which has plenty of diplomatic business of its own
to look after. In one department, and that a very important one,
the whole of Nileland will, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_276">[276]</span> be so organized in practice. When the great
schemes for the final binding of the Nile are put in hand, they
must be all under one control, and that control will be exercised
from Cairo. It would be intolerable and impossible that every time
it was thought desirable to open the Reservoir gates, say of Lake
Albert, there should have to be negotiations between district
governments or departments. The water of the Nile has made its
powerful political influence felt throughout the Soudan; in time it
will play its part in Uganda.</p>

<p>But such semi-continental speculations are unprofitable except
for those who have some power to realize them. For the present the
horizon of Soudan politics is bounded by the railway. From its
completion all immediate plans of progress must take their start.
It would be foolish to take too sanguine a view. Railway
communication between Khartoum and the Red Sea will not smooth away
all the difficulties of administration. There will still be years
of low Nile and scanty rainfall. There will still be an abominable
climate during a large portion of the year. Mosquitoes, sand-flies,
and other insects will still ply their uncomfortable occupations.
Dhurra will still suffer from curious and unique parasites. Cattle
will be subject to murrain. Perhaps cotton, free from ‘worm’ and
‘hog,’ will discover some new foe to combat. Locusts and white ants
will still occasionally devour what they ought not, and possibly
develop fresh objectionable tastes. New Mahdis, unconvinced by the
doom of their predecessors, may still require to be put down from
time to time. Economic laws cannot be expected to work with the
same certainty and freedom from cross-currents as<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span> they do in Egypt. In other
words, the Soudan is a tropical country, subject to surprises: it
will have its ups and downs like other places. These and similar
difficulties it would have to face, railway or no railway. But
beyond question, once the line is open, it will be in a far better
position to grapple with them all, and to reap the benefits of the
sound foundations which are now being solidly and patiently laid by
the handful of Englishmen to whose charge its destinies have been
entrusted by Fate. And whatever else of good or evil the future may
have in store, the Soudan has one treasure which makes it certain
that it will never again be allowed to lapse from the pale of
civilization, and that is not the gold which attracted the
attention of its former invaders, with such disastrous consequences
both to conquerors and conquered, but the inestimable possession of
the Nile.</p>

<p>I have given the discharge in cubic metres per second, the unit
generally in use on the Nile. On the Thames the figures are usually
given in gallons per day, which sounds much more imposing. If the
number of cubic metres per second is multiplied by about 1,900,000,
it gives approximately the number of gallons per day. But, after
all, the discharge of the Thames in June, 1903, was not so very far
below that of the Nile during the same month.</p>
